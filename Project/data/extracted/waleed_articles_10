**********Who's in, who's out: Trump's version of modern society********May 12, 2016******348**** So, Sadiq Khan has been elected the new mayor of London: a man who, if Donald Trump is elected president of the United States, would be barred from entering the country because he's a Muslim.Re-read that sentence. A Trump presidency. A Muslim mayor of London. A ban on Muslims entering the US (which Trump has only recently reiterated as a pledge to be delivered in his first 100 days). There is not a single element of that I could even have imagined writing as recently as a year ago.And yet I can think of no story that better distils the times; that so efficiently captures something so much greater than itself.This isn't simply the story of a Muslim, a populist and a policy. It's not even simply a story of multiculturalism and nationalism. It's the story of two completely irreconcilable, contradictory worlds that after decades of circling, are now colliding. To this end, Trump and Khan are but two more or less inevitable – even if until recently unthinkable – symbols.Sadiq Khan is, as much as anyone can be, the organic face of London. This is now a city composed entirely of minorities, its white British population having dropped below 50 per cent years ago. Something like 12 per cent of its population hails from the subcontinent, and a similar number are Muslims.That's what thoroughly global cities are like, these days. They are impossibly cosmopolitan, impossible to describe in simple caricature. They have no single culture, no single personification, not even a static identity. They are cities constantly being made and remade on the run; their only constant is their evolution and ever-expanding diversity. A city like that will eventually produce a Sadiq Khan, as it does a Boris Johnson.This is something new. Sure, London has always been global. But once upon a time that meant it was the seat of a global empire. It was global on British terms. The hierarchy was clear, even among the Empire's varied subjects.These days, it's global on the market's terms. Culture, power, hierarchy, it's all largely what money makes it. As the obscenely expensive foreign-owned apartments sitting vacant in Mayfair attest, it is becoming the world's bank; a place where the super-rich can park their capital.That kind of transformation doesn't just demand a new economy. It demands a new sociology. Every society – every village, city, nation – requires bonds of solidarity to hold it together. The great cities – London and New York chief among them – find an identity in the very fact of their dizzying diversity. It's the kind of self-image that means most voters simply fail to see an issue in voting for a Muslim candidate.Khan's electorate has a kind of effortless cosmopolitanism: comfortable with societies whose frontiers keep moving, and able to see him as merely one person among them. That's why the campaign against him – that almost boringly predictable attempt to label him a Muslim extremist – failed so terribly. It just rings so untrue to people of that city, and encourages people only to reaffirm the tolerance they value in themselves.Hence the estimation of one former Tory cabinet minister, that the anti-Khan campaign was "utterly ludicrous" and probably "gave him a bigger majority".It's simple enough – and true enough – to see Donald Trump as the equal and opposite reaction to this kind of thing. But we should perhaps acknowledge the nuances of what that means.Beneath the bigotry that so often dazzles us is the appeal to something meaningful. Trump is selling authenticity. A false version of it, sure. But a version of it nonetheless.For all the ridiculous bombast, Trump is a recognisably American character: the brash billionaire who, if you squint, symbolises the possibilities of American success. But he marries this with a kind of nostalgic nationalism that has Mexicans walled out and Muslims repelled.In doing that, Trump is also offering a kind of solidarity. But unlike the fluid, cosmopolitan solidarity shared by Khan's voters, Trump is pointing to something more grounded and static. And that's so appealing precisely because it's such a contrast from the alternative.This isn't politics as usual. Politics used to be about how we should govern society, and how power and resources should be distributed within it. This new contest is about the very definition of society in the first place; about who's in and who's out. That is, it is precisely a contest of solidarity; a contest between a global national identity, and a more parochial, ethnicised one.For a democracy, that is elemental. At a certain level, democracy is about the mutual according of rights. It requires us to put up with, rather than seek to dominate each other. But that only works when we feel some overarching solidarity towards even those citizens we don't like.Take that away, and democracy becomes a sheer, brutal numbers game. Hence the famous observation of sociologist Michael Mann that in extreme cases democracies plus ethnic diversity equals ethnic cleansing.Societies like ours, or Britain's, or the US's are simply too diverse to fall apart in quite that way. But it's also true they're beginning to fray.The US case is most obvious, but even Australia, which has been admirably resistant to the most virulent strains of nationalist politics is seeing more of it now. Hence the arrival of new fringe minor parties, anti-political fads like the Palmer United Party, and the increased influence of hard-right members of the Coalition. And we're seeing it at precisely the same time as the politics of hyper-diversity are becoming ever stronger.That's not an accident. It's a contradiction that has been building ever since globalisation became a buzzword. It's just that now it's becoming explicit in ways we weren't expecting.When Trump decided to set up an anti-Muslim forcefield around the US, he would have wanted it to keep Sadiq Khan out.Definitely not the mayor of London, though.
**********The monstrous failure of our bipartisan asylum seeker policy********April 28, 2016******561**** Perhaps the most stupefying aspect of our asylum seeker debate is that we call it a debate in the first place. It's not. It's a complete political consensus. Our current policies are a bipartisan concoction; the result of years of mutual posturing, outflanking and then outbidding. "You're banishing asylum seekers to detention centres in the Australian desert? Fine, we'll send them to Nauru for processing!" "You're still resettling them here? We'll banish them forever!" "Oh yeah? We'll get an army general to do it!" And so on.It's hugely disingenuous. The Coalition claims sole credit for stopping the boats, never acknowledging that the most important part of its policy – the mandatory shunting of people to Nauru and Papua New Guinea, never to return to Australia – was Kevin Rudd's. The Coalition added some turnbacks and maybe some other things they've decided are top secret, but the truth is that boat arrivals slowed significant before Tony Abbott was even elected. Labor, meanwhile, is happy to blame the Coalition for whatever aspect of the policy disintegrates, never acknowledging its role in the catastrophe. That's what is particularly nauseating about watching Labor trying to make political mileage out of asylum seeker policy. And on that score, what a nauseating week it has been."They have botched this from day one," puffed Labor's immigration spokesman Richard Marles when Papua New Guinea's Supreme Court ruled our detention centre there to be illegal. But here's the problem: that centre was always illegal. It didn't suddenly become illegal when Abbott took power. Marles is right it was botched from day one, but that was Labor's day. It takes some special level of gall to establish an illegal detention centre, then insist it's the Coalition's mess.There's no great surprise here. This was such an obvious violation of the PNG constitution that the PNG government tried frantically in 2014 to change the constitution to make it legal. When the moment of truth arrived, neither the PNG nor Australian governments mounted a meaningful defence. This die was long cast. Marles' only real defence is to say this whole centre should be empty by now; that we might have got away with it if only the getaway car had turned up on time. Hence: "PNG never imagined people would be on Manus for so long – we didn't either."Well, that's a monstrous failure of imagination, then. Because while it's true Labor said its Manus centre would be empty in a year, it's also true there was no plan to make that happen. It was an entirely unaccountable dream: a declaration utterly devoid of meaning. Labor never knew where these people would be resettled, once found to be refugees. It never handed the Coalition a stack of agreements with other countries guaranteeing these people would have a home. It passed on a detention regime made of matchsticks. Now it stands ready to tut, the moment things collapse.No, the real feat of imagination here would have been to pretend this could end any other way. Because the PNG Supreme Court this week did nothing more than reveal the obvious: that our policy was only ever to sweep asylum seekers under someone else's rug. It was designed to stop boats coming to us, but solve no greater problem than that. We've not brokered an agreement with our regional neighbours to share the load, because we've preferred instead to bribe the poorest nations into removing the problem from our sight. Occasionally, as in Cambodia's case, we've paid them dozens of millions of dollars for almost exactly nothing.Pursue that kind of non-policy and eventually it catches up with you. Manus is full of people already found to be refugees, stuck in a country that says it simply cannot afford to take them, and right next to one that very easily could. They're there because "stop the boats" – in truth a bipartisan slogan – only ever masked a question we could never answer: what happens to these people? What happens to the ones who don't die at sea, or the ones we convince to return home? Do they die elsewhere? We don't really know because the minute they aren't on boats headed for us, they cease to exist. And as far as we're concerned, their misery doesn't exist either.That's why all the stories simply wash over us. Reza Berati is killed under our care. The ABC's Four Corners program reveals that Hamid Khazaei died because the Immigration Department pointlessly delayed vital medical treatment. This week we learnt an Iranian man set himself on fire in Nauru. None of this fundamentally moves us because we've constructed an elaborate world that makes this simply the cost of doing business, rather than anything that registers as a series of tragedies we've helped create. Nothing gets in the way, except when a court uses brute force.That's when you'll find Richard Marles, not questioning how his own party's scheme could be so hopelessly conceived, but demanding Peter Dutton fly to PNG to keep this thing alive. Somehow. Anyhow. It's also when you'll find Peter Dutton responding by saying refugees from Manus "will not be settled in Australia". That's not even remotely an answer to the question of what we'll do now that our main policy has been quashed. But it is the only thing anyone since Rudd has ever needed to say.Except now we're being asked a different question. It's telling that PNG Prime Minister Peter O'Neill has "welcomed this outcome" from the Supreme Court. It's telling that he so quickly confirmed he would shut the centre. It's telling that he said the centre "has done a lot more damage than probably anything else". Seems even the bribery isn't enough any more. Our servants are turning and their courts are catching up with us. The design flaws of our policy are slowly being exposed. Labor can try to revel if it likes, but let's be abundantly clear: it's revelling in its own failure.
**********Banking royal commission: Turnbull's budget policy responds to Labor's agenda********April 14, 2016******334**** As budget headlines go, anything involving the Australian Securities and Investments Commission is a real bore. It's nothing like, say, GP co-payments, or cuts to education or kicking unemployed kids off the dole. So, no one's blood boiled when the Abbott-Hockey budget of 2014 stripped $120 million from ASIC over five years, or when it lost more than 12 per cent of its staff from 2013.And yet this week that snore-inducing item suddenly mattered. It mattered so much that Scott Morrison began talking about reversing them, even as he is gleefully restating his determination to rein spending in.This attracted scarce attention but it's a genuinely revealing moment. It arises, of course, in the context of Labor's call for a royal commission into our banks: a call the Turnbull government (some backbenchers aside) instinctively rejects. ASIC is the figleaf for this. "Tough cop on the beat"; "greater powers than a royal commission" – all that. And yet in making this argument, the government immediately invited a smacking on how it gutted this very institution. Hence the attempt to neutralise the line of attack.And so the government is now making policy in response to an agenda led by Labor. That's about the best thing you can ever say of an opposition. It's also one of the most telling things you can say of a government. It happened to John Howard when Kevin Rudd arrived, and to each incarnation of Labor that Tony Abbott bludgeoned.Abbott's own collapse was a different matter – the result of endless self-inflicted wounds – but now Turnbull has restored the pattern. And in this is distilled the essential difference between Abbott and Turnbull's leadership: Abbott pursued a surprise agenda that offended the electorate; Turnbull has so far refused to offer one.It's a simple enough idea that Shorten might fill Turnbull's vacuum. But what makes this astonishing is how Shorten has ended up filling it. I date Labor's revival to somewhere near the launch of its negative gearing policy, to which it has since added the whiff of reducing capital gains tax concessions. Before that it announced its intentions to close superannuation tax concessions for the wealthy. Now it is rounding on the banks, buoyed by the accumulated scandals and mini-scandals from within the industry.It's remarkable enough that Labor would return to contention at the same time as it is releasing policy. That often doesn't work for oppositions as John Hewson could explain to you uninterrupted for days.But now think about this suite of policies. Superannuation loopholes aside – which even most in the industry accept aren't sustainable – they read like what, only a few years ago, would have been a checklist of crazy ideas. Negative gearing used to be the kind of thing over-enthusiastic letter-writers would scribble about. And banks? These were the inviolable behemoths of our corporate ecosystem. We could grumble about them, even fashionably hate them.Politicians would join in when, say, it suited them as a diversion from bad news on interest rates. Occasionally there might even be an inquiry, as with the Campbell Inquiry in 1981 and the 1997 Wallis Inquiry. But a royal commission? Calling them seriously into question as though they were unions? Madness, for the last 30 years at least.It's easy to see the ghost of revenge in all this. A royal commission into banks is the negative image of Abbott's one into trade unions. That incensed Labor, which thought it outrageously political. But there's more going on here because it's not an isolated jab. The thing about Labor's policies is that they're mutually reinforcing. Like them or not, they're coherent.Labor's begun doing something it has resoundingly failed to do for decades now. It's discovering a worldview, even if not yet in a very detailed way. And it's slaughtering sacred cows to do it.This is no small thing for Labor. Much has been written (including by me) about the pointlessness of Labor after Keating; of how the Hawke-Keating reforms transformed the country, but also annihilated labour politics; of how it ushered in a liberal consensus that left Labor with nowhere to go and nothing to say. But now that consensus is cracking.As the inequities of capitalism have become clearer, and as crises like the global financial meltdown seem to have dealt out pain mainly to those who had least responsibility for creating them, we've witnessed a growing popular sense of disillusionment. And every now and then, something like the Panama Papers comes along to refresh this sense that the whole thing might just be a rort: that gaping inequality doesn't mean everyone's doing better, and might instead mean money and power keep flowing to those who already have it.That's a global cynicism, visible in a diverse range of movements from Occupy to Thomas Piketty's criticisms of 21st-century capital, to Donald Trump. But in Australia it was weirdly accelerated by the Abbott government's first budget, which the electorate immediately, irrevocably and viscerally condemned as unfair. In a stroke it seems Abbott recast Australian politics.Where Howard had made principally a game of surpluses and cultural security, the backlash to Abbott's brief premiership suddenly made "fairness" the cardinal virtue. Indeed, Turnbull is trapped by it. By his own admission, every policy idea will have to pass that test. But that leaves him with precious few options that will please his constituency and his colleagues.In this way, the stars have aligned for Labor. Domestic politics is now centred on a Labor-ish concept at precisely the same time that a new global scepticism of the free market is emerging. As a result it finds itself roughly in tune with the domestic mood, while it has a steady stream of international stories about, say, corporate tax avoidance to bolster its campaigns.Of course, these things are only properly tested in government. But if the times came to suit John Howard, it's possible they're slowly coming to suit Labor. That's probably why it's now unafraid to call time on the liberal consensus that has made it an irrelevant political force. A consensus, ironically, it helped create.
**********Why Australia lies to itself about its Indigenous history********March 31, 2016******475**** Every country has its weirdness, its reflex points that trigger spontaneous, uncontrolled actions that look almost comically irrational to the observer. It's the kind of thing you can only comprehend once you know the anatomy.Take, for example, the United States' permanent weirdness on guns. Viewed from Australia – a nation that embraced gun control with relative (though not total) ease after a single massacre – it's gobsmacking that repeated mass shootings seem only to entrench positions rather than inspire a solution.It's only when you grasp how guns have become totems of individual liberty and a principled distrust of government – and that these ideas constitute nothing less than the country's very reason for being – that you can begin to make sense of the madness.So, beneath every weirdness most likely is a revelation. Not about the substance of whatever issue is in play, but about the essence of the nation grappling with it.For Australia, it's Indigenous history. The US may be caught in a cycle of tragedy and denial, but we simply do away with the cycle. For us it's a founding tragedy, then steadfast denial ever since. The specifics might change – terra nullius, the stolen generations – but the constant is a remarkable jumpiness at the very thought of facing the past. A jumpiness so powerfully reflexive, it doesn't matter how insignificant the stimulus.This week it's a guide on "Indigenous Terminology" from the University of New South Wales. As documents go, it's resoundingly minor: an advisory list, likely to be read by very few people, that "clarifies appropriate language" on Indigenous history and culture. But that was enough to start the nation's most prolific outrage machines to humming."WHITEWASH", boomed The Daily Telegraph, taking particular exception at the guide's suggestion that Australia was not "settled" or "discovered" by the British, but rather "invaded, occupied and colonised". This instantly triggered the talkback reflex, with lines of angry callers – historians all, no doubt – venting with all the gusto Alan Jones or Ray Hadley could inspire in them. For colour, and certainly not content, Sydney radio host Kyle Sandilands joined the party, ensuring the meltdown covered all frequencies.Where do you start? Perhaps with the Tele's remarkably sloppy allegation that "UNSW rewrites the history books to state Cook 'invaded' Australia". Of course, UNSW did no such thing. The reference to Cook is entirely a Telegraph invention. The guide talks of invasion but doesn't attribute it to James Cook, who had no army with which to invade. It's an extrapolation showing that not only does some editor or other know nothing about the history they're so keen to defend, but that they're also quite keen to rewrite the present.Or perhaps you might begin with precisely which historical account does the rewriting: the one of "settlement" with its implications of an uninhabited continent, or the one whose language of invasion and colonisation implies the significant resistance of Indigenous people and the slaughter that flowed as a result?All that history is well trodden. For now, it's the weirdness of this, and what it reveals, that interests me. Specifically: why is this hysterical response so entirely predictable? Why is it that the moment the language of invasion appears, we seem so instinctively threatened by it? This isn't the response of sober historical disagreement. It's more visceral than that. Elemental even. It's like any remotely honest appraisal of our history – even one contained in an obscure university guide – has the power to trigger some kind of existential meltdown. What strange insecurity is this?An American observing this, perhaps even while carrying a gun, would be entitled to be bewildered. Theirs is a dark history too – one that encompasses indigenous dispossession, slavery and segregation – but it's a history they can hardly be accused of denying in the way we do.Sure, indigenous American history is frequently ignored, but this is partly because it is buried beneath the sheer tonnage of black history that is so constantly rehearsed. There will be people in the US south who lament losing the Civil War, and who cling to the Confederate flag. But it's hard to imagine a public freak-out because a university wanted to discuss slavery. By now, slavery and its abolition are central parts of the American story. There might be varying degrees of honesty in the way the US tells that story, but it has typically found a way to incorporate its warts.Why do we struggle so much more? Demography, sure. It's harder to brush aside the claims of 13 per cent of the population than the roughly 2 per cent of ours that is Indigenous. But it's also a function of national mythology.The US is built on the idea of constant progress through individual liberty. It's a nation that is never finished, never perfect, but always being perfected. Its historical scars are therefore not fatal to its identity. Indeed, they are essential because they allow Americans to tell a story of their own perfectibility. In these hands, slavery is not simply a stain, but a symbol of how far they've come. So, in the process of acknowledging slavery, the US is celebrated, not condemned.We're not like that. We struggle with our history because once we admit it, we have nowhere to go with it; no way of rehabilitating our pride; no way of understanding ourselves. As a nation, we lack a national mythology that can cope with our shortcomings. That transforms our historical scars into fatal psychological wounds, leaving us with a bizarre need to insist everything was – and is – as good as it gets.That's the true meaning of the love-it-or-leave-it ethos that so stubbornly persists. We don't want to be improved in any thorough way, because for us that seems to imply thorough imperfections.Instead, we want to be praised, to be acknowledged as a success. It's a kind of national supplication, a constant search for validation. And history's fine, as long as it serves that purpose. But if it dares step out of line, it can expect to be slapped swiftly with the Sandilands dictum until it changes the subject: "you're full of shit, just get on with life". Then we can be comfortable again.
**********World's elite wisdom may no longer matter as new winners create losers********March 18, 2016******238**** I write this from London, where Donald Trump is only the second biggest story. But it's an instructive vantage point from which to watch the Republican odyssey. In one sense, it's about the furthest place you can imagine from Trump's unvarnished parochialism. Trump probably sounds foreign to anyone not in his thrall: like the themes are vaguely familiar but the language isn't.But in London – a thoroughly global city – Trump inhabits a completely different planet. He's not merely talking strangely – something of a feat in a city that's home to more than 300 languages – he's expressing inconceivable thoughts. Mexicans (or Arabs or Asians) aren't remarkable here. London doesn't build walls. It's boundless.But in another sense, this is the kind of city that made Trump. Its increasing number of kinky skyscrapers stand as testaments to global capital: shiny, innovative. London has always had a sense of old money – how could it not with its parade of palaces and castles? Now it's just money. Money with no apparent local history, and certainly no need for it. The kind of money that is its own justification. Money that, to riff on a central Trump theme, wins.But all that winning creates losers. London is now systematically expelling its own people because, with the fabulously wealthy parking their money there, it's an increasingly rare Londoner who can even afford to rent. Soon we'll see schools unable to find teachers because no one on a teacher's salary can live close enough to work there. Turns out this glorious, boundless world has boundaries after all. It erects its walls, too, just not with Trump's bellicosity.If you're walled out in America, there's a good chance you're presently waving Trump placards. That's not merely an American phenomenon so much as a quintessentially American expression of a global one. To see that we need only glance at the biggest story in these parts: Britain's serious flirtation with leaving the European Union.That decision will be made by a popular vote in June, and it suddenly seems a close-run thing. And that's no small matter because, while Euroscepticism has always had its place in British politics, it has never been the orthodoxy.There are many reasons for the political change – including David Cameron's struggle to control his own party and the rise of the UK Independence Party – but it is perhaps most revealing to listen to the way pro-European voices tend to speak as they explain what's at stake. It's the language of economic opportunity, of radical mobility.Probe a little and you'll hear arguments about how wonderful it is to be able to relocate, without much of a thought, to take up a job – or indeed buy property – in Spain. Then France or, I dunno, Portugal, before whizzing back to London. Listening to this it sounds fantastically enticing. But then, I've just whizzed to London myself. It's roughly then that it dawns on me.These arguments all belong to the elite. It's an experience of Europe that simply doesn't ring true to the struggling classes. It's hard to value the opportunity to up sticks for the continent when it's not one that applies to you. Not everyone surveys Europe and sees a field of dreams.Millions are more likely to see a source of competition, for jobs, for houses, for everything. That's why the ugly side of this, centred on the influx of Eastern European migrants, is never far from the surface of this debate. It's not cogent – Britain's terrible housing crisis is a familiar story of undersupply and hyperactive investors, not swooping Poles – but it's a powerful enough image to stick.The themes here are closer to Trump than might immediately appear. The incessant media focus on Trump's outrages masks the fact that he's also running a seriously protectionist campaign: ironically suspicious of free trade and protective of an American underclass for whom the triumphs of capitalism seem only to flow elsewhere. It's not arguing that the system never works. It's that it always works for the same people: the establishment who write the laws for the benefits of their friends and themselves. If that's not you, chances are you feel thoroughly disempowered, whether you live in the world's most powerful nation or not.So, "Make America Great Again". Or to cast it in Brexit language, reclaim Britain's sovereignty, even freedom. In each case, it's really a promise of power and control. Even if those promises are completely overblown and doomed to fail (and I think they are) it's hard to deny their attraction.It's also an explicit rejection of the gospel of the last 30 years. It's a long time since we've seen mass movements in domestic politics gather around something quite that radical.That's what makes this a big moment: the sense that everything right now is up for question; that elite wisdom may no longer count as wisdom at all. Trump's politics of scandal and political incorrectness works because it's really a war on orthodoxy. And if Britain can leave the EU, perhaps it will be a sign that we're in the age of the heretic.
**********The slow-motion death of conservative politics********March 4, 2016******346**** Just as well Malcolm Turnbull is such a fan of disruption. Right now, he's in a world of it. This is the week Tony Abbott's wrecking, undermining and sniping campaign went nuclear, or at least marine. His intervention on the Turnbull government's alleged delay in acquiring new submarines is about as destructively disruptive as it gets, really.Abbott has already undermined his successor on same-sex marriage (or even bullying), tax policy, industrial relations, even national security. But now even the veneer of respectful disagreement is gone. "I'm not just disappointed, I'm flabbergasted at this decision," he told The Australian, before suggesting Turnbull had compromised our "national self-respect".He's accepted the role of disillusioned commentator on a story about a leak of classified documents. A leak, by the way, the Australian Federal Police have now seen fit to investigate. Even in the event the leak has nothing to do with him, it's a hell of a thing to dignify, and a hell of a way to do it.And so, inevitably, come the Rudd comparisons. Now, openly from his front-bench colleagues. And sure, it's beginning to look a lot like Labor. But it's perhaps a little too easy a reference point. Rudd's white-anting was really about the fury of a Prime Minister scorned; a man seeking to right a wrong through revenge. Otherwise, it had no real content. That's why when Rudd finally retook the throne, there was no policy reason given and no obvious policy consequence.I don't doubt Abbott's story is also one of revenge. But there's more to it than that. Abbott's sniping is actually about something. He's trying to rehabilitate not merely his reputation, but his entire brand of politics.That's why he's constantly choosing totemic issues to agitate: even ones for which he had no appetite as Prime Minister, like industrial relations. That's why his supporters are a crew of ideological warriors and not a reluctant collection of pragmatists as in Rudd's case. And that's why it threatens to do more long-term damage to the Coalition than even the Rudd-Gillard catastrophe did to Labor.This, I suspect, is the slow-motion disintegration of conservative politics that's bigger than Abbott, or Turnbull, or even Australia. Indeed we're seeing it most spectacularly in the United States, where, following his domination of Super Tuesday, Donald Trump is cruising towards the Republican presidential nomination.This he has achieved despite the fact almost every Republican elder opposes him. They always have. During the last election season the Republican candidates cancelled a scheduled debate when the relevant news outlet announced Trump would be the moderator. Now, some Republican heads are spitballing ways they can use party rules to deny him the nomination even though his mandate from Republican voters is so strong.This, too, is a party now out of control. But in truth it has been slowly spiralling out of control for years. Do you think Trump is heinous on immigration because he wants to build a wall to keep out Mexicans? So does the establishment's own Ted Cruz. Do you think Trump's declaration that climate change is a hoax makes him unworthy of office? Here's the other establishment candidate, Marco Rubio: "I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it." At least he seems to believe the science is in. He just chooses not to accept it.It's true in a sense that Trump has stolen the Republican party. But it's also true it was there for the taking. There are many reasons Trump is succeeding – anger and disillusionment among a humiliated electorate is one of them. But there's also the fact that the Republicans have been training their voters to indulge every reactionary prejudice for years. Trump simply does this better, louder, and with less varnish than his rivals. Can we be surprised when he vanquishes them? Can the Republican establishment really cry foul when he outdoes them?And is it so different here? Well, in a way, yes. A moderate is presently in the top job and the reactionary forces aren't yet taking endorsements from former Ku Klux Klan wizards (they'll have to settle for Reclaim Australia for now). But there's an important commonality too: that the contradictions that were once holding conservative parties together, and delivering them political success, have now fallen apart. The most important of these is the contradiction between liberal economics and the politics of "values".It's hard to be the staunch defenders of family, culture and tradition while you're also staunch advocates of things like high-skilled immigration and workplace "flexibility" of the kind WorkChoices offered. It's hard to believe the market should be free to exploit and commodify whatever consumers will tolerate – sex, culture, children – and yet pretend we are bound together by inviolable, sacred values.Liberal economics has this habit of being, well, disruptive. Trying to mitigate that by playing the politics of culture will eventually descend into bigotry. The more the culture being defended is hollowed out, the more it can only take the form of finding symbols to rail against. That's why we've seen such an inexhaustible parade of targets: immigrants, refugees, Muslims, greenies, gays, women, blacks, Mexicans.Every broad political movement has its contradictions. Successful ones conceal them long enough to enjoy power – and there's no doubt this neo-conservatism had its glory. But eventually, you face that moment when an earthquake turns a fault line into a canyon; when a movement's contradictions consume it. At that point it either splits, or one side becomes unleashed.There's no easy resolution for Turnbull because the disruption is deep and determined. And there's no easy response for the Republicans who must now witness what they have unleashed.
**********Malcolm Turnbull, stop dithering on tax reform and tell us what you really think********February 18, 2016******320**** So after all that, turns out the most important thing right now is that we all get tax cuts. All that "budget emergency" stuff was apparently just a confusing prelude, consigned firmly to the past.Nowadays, budget repair is "a Test match not a Twenty20 Big Bash" in the Treasurer's memorable phrase of the week. Seems the required run rate isn't as impossibly high as we thought. We just need to bat time. Which is just as well because we haven't been scoring for a while now: "We are basically in the same position that we were two years ago," Scott Morrison admitted at the National Press Club. Remember when the government breezily claimed it had halved the deficit? Yeah. Nah.In truth, it's a welcome moment of sense. The budget problem was only ever a midterm problem and not an emergency. And yes, tax cuts would be lovely given that bracket creep means average earners are being taxed at elite marginal rates.But it's also true that the current budget – even with its ballooning deficit – relies heavily on bracket creep to rescue it. And now, with the GST left stranded at the altar, we learn that whatever tax cuts Morrison offers will necessarily be "far more modest". It's hereabouts the warning signs are visible.What's the point of all this, exactly? Precisely when, and exactly why, did tax cuts become the pillar around which the Turnbull government's budget plans would revolve? Why are they more important than, say, funding the hospitals and schools which the states insist they simply cannot afford to keep running? Or more important than reducing the deficit? And if they really are that important, for whatever barely explained reason, what's the point of making them so modest?There might well be answers to these questions. But one of the key lessons of the Turnbull government's failed GST foray was that it seemed remarkably uninterested in providing them. Yes, a raised GST wasn't popular. But it was more popular (37 per cent) than the Labor Party, whose primary vote is (up!) at about 29 per cent. It wasn't, therefore, a necessarily lost cause.The problem was that no one – including several on the Coalition backbench – knew why we were even thinking about raising the GST. The GST conversation very quickly became one in which we were being asked to pay a price, for no clearly identified benefit. How was that ever meant to succeed?What's missing here is Turnbull's story. His explanation of what matters and why; of what is worthy of our sacrifice and what exactly we're trying to achieve. It's not really precise enough to criticise this as a do-nothing government. It's more a go-nowhere government right now.Floating ideas – perhaps even good ones – but to no obvious end; with no unmistakable direction. It's a government as yet without a purpose. It has a series of positions it inherited from Tony Abbott – on climate change, same-sex marriage most famously, but also on things like welfare cuts for low-income families that everyone has forgotten about but which remain part of the government's budget.Mostly, though, it has a table with lots of things on it. "Everything", in fact. Except the stuff, like the GST that suddenly isn't. Now Labor's put together a negative gearing policy which Morrison reckons is silly, but has chucked on the table anyway. Open-mindedness is fabulous. But not if there aren't any criteria to figure out what ultimately to accept.Labor, meanwhile, is strangely coherent. More coherent than it has been in years. It's systematically going through tax concessions and loopholes that favour big companies and wealthy people, and pledging to capture that money to spend on wildly popular things like the hospitals and schools mentioned above. Leftovers will be used to reduce the deficit.No one's listening, of course, which masks the fact that right now, the Turnbull government is being comprehensively outdone on policy. Not necessarily in the sense that Labor's policies are better – indeed you're free to detest them. More in the sense that Labor actually has them. And that it has a simple story to tell about them. It's a strange look, this. An anonymous, invisible opposition offering politically risky policies as though it's a secure government, and a politically secure government playing small-target politics as though it's in opposition.Of course, none of this means Turnbull will struggle at this year's election. He won't. Forget this week's murmurings that his honeymoon is now in eclipse; that the parade of ministerial scandals and departures and party divisions have rendered us newly sceptical. He'll win easily as almost everyone in Labor expects. But as Abbott so powerfully showed us, winning an election doesn't necessarily mean much. If you have no mandate, no clear reason for being, you'll quickly find you've snookered yourself.Abbott's position became unsalvageable because his opponents had a stronger story about him than he had of himself. And Abbott, having pledged only to abolish taxes while making no cuts to anything and somehow fixing the budget, had no way of recasting himself as something electable.Labor will paint Turnbull as the Prime Minister who is happy to sacrifice health and education for the ability of wealthy people to gain investment properties; or for the sake of "modest" tax cuts you'll barely feel; or for something else like that. It will lose, but it will plant a seed.And if Turnbull doesn't take advantage of his impregnable position to hammer a world view of his own, he might at length be strangled by the weeds.
**********Nauru: How long can we keep lying to ourselves?********February 5, 2016******415**** Wonderful idea, sovereignty. It conveys this reassuring sense of control; a sense that on each of our own patches, we're in charge and things happen by some exercise of our own free choice. And maybe that sense isn't an illusion. Maybe, for example, Nauru just happened to choose to open a "regional processing centre" for asylum seekers. And maybe it just happened to put an Australian government office in it. And maybe it just happened to ask the people in that office – who just happen to be Australians – if they could wear Australian government uniforms with the Australian coat of arms on them while they deal with the detainees in that centre.Maybe it's mere happenstance that Nauru has made visas all but impossible for journalists to obtain if they want to scrutinise these detention arrangements, in a manner eerily similar to the way the Australian government routinely denies journalists access to our own detention centres.Maybe that same happenstance accounts for the fact that the single journalist to have been the exception to this rule in the past two years is a dedicated supporter of the Australian government's asylum-seeker policies.And maybe Nauru's sudden decision to open the gates of its detention centre so its detainees could roam freely around (but not leave) Nauru had nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that the Australian government was – at precisely the same time – in danger of losing a case in the High Court that would bring its offshore detention regime crashing down.And maybe all that has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that the Australian government pays for that centre. And nothing to do with the fact under our government's agreement with Nauru, we have the right to step in and take over the centre whenever we like. Maybe all this is some completely free, unbounded choice of Nauru's that miraculously happens to coincide with the Australian government's interests again and again.So maybe it's true that while the arrival of boats of asylum seekers in our waters is severe enough to mean people smugglers are robbing us of our sovereignty, our own official, uniformed control of Nauru's detention centre somehow leaves theirs perfectly intact.Or maybe that's all crap. It matters because whatever it is, we're building our asylum-seeker policy on it. That has been true for years now. Perhaps you've noticed how often when controversy arrives, say in the form of some act of abuse in these detention centres, these things become matters for Nauru. Nauru has become a screen behind which we hide our own culpability; its sovereignty a charade, really – a sort of legal fiction we use to obscure the consequences of our own policy even as we claim its successes.This week we learned those consequences might have included the rape of a five-year-old boy. And this week, the High Court confirmed the government has every legal right to send him straight back to the scene of that alleged crime. And who could honestly claim to be surprised if the government did exactly that?The horror of this thought is obvious. But perhaps the greatest horror is that as a nation, we've now become so hopelessly addicted to the fictions that justify it. It's not just the fiction of Nauru. It's also the fiction of Australia, which you might recall we've declared simply doesn't exist if you're coming here by boat. You can dock in Sydney Harbour if you like, and as far as the law is concerned, you simply never arrived here. But there's also the fiction that Nauru and Papua New Guinea were ever anything more than a dumping ground for us.If these countries were truly something more, we'd have known from the beginning how the asylum seekers we were sending there would be resettled. Or indeed that it was going to happen at all. But there was never any plan. There still isn't. The "regional processing centre" in Nauru seems drastically misnamed given precious little processing is actually happening. Remember last year when we heard the 600 remaining detainees on Nauru would be processed within a week? Many weeks on, 537 remain.This as we've paid Cambodia $55 million to resettle almost nobody (or four nobodies to be precise). And while we've been belatedly scouring the region looking for countries to take asylum seekers off our hands, we've flatly rejected an offer from New Zealand to resettle 150 of them each year. Resettlement in New Zealand, you see, would encourage more boats.Note, here, the tacit admission that our policy is to send them to places so bad they couldn't possibly want to live there. Only then, it seems, will they stop coming. It's a problem that goes back to the very inception of this policy, implemented in the last throes of Kevin Rudd's political career. Labor's present objection that people were not meant to be "languishing in indefinite detention" is so profoundly hypocritical because it ignores that the Rudd government had never arranged anything else.Ultimately, this whole issue exists in a world of make-believe: make-believe borders, make-believe compliance with the refugee convention, and make-believe resettlement policy. Among all the moral injuries we've inflicted on ourselves in this sordid area of politics – and there are many – the most overlooked is how adept we've become at lying to ourselves.One day, when the history of this period is written, it will be a story of how successive governments have legislated their lies. How John Howard, then Julia Gillard made real their pretence that boat arrivals never got here, so we could be good international citizens yet still owe these people nothing. How Tony Abbott passed a law in June last year to ensure Rudd's Nauru arrangement was legal, and how that law pretended it had been in force ever since 2012.I don't know if we can do this forever; if eventually our lawmaking won't be able to outrun our lying. But I know that buried in this week's High Court judgment is unanimous agreement the government simply cannot detain people indefinitely on Nauru. At some point, the clock runs out. And on that day, maybe the alarm will sound on these mighty fictions that have been sustaining us. Then who will we be?
**********Why Mosul’s Sunnis find Islamic State death squads the lesser of two evils********January 21, 2016******263**** I guess leaders of Islamic State are fiscal conservatives. This week we learnt they recently decided to slash salaries in the public service – in their case, fighters – by half. Apparently IS doesn't do deficits. So, confronted by plunging revenue and losing cash rapidly, it could only implore its people to sacrifice for the cause.This is excellent news for several reasons. First, it reflects an enterprise in trouble.IS doesn't detail the "exceptional circumstances" that make the pay cut necessary, but they're simple to discern: significant losses of land – up to 40 per cent of what it held in Iraq and 20 per cent of its Syrian territory – including much of its money-making gas and oil fields. Moreover, things are only becoming worse. IS famously lost Ramadi last month, and last week saw something in the order of tens of millions of dollars literally blown up when a US air strike hit a cash facility in Mosul.Second, the lower pay threatens to harm the organisation's recruitment. That might surprise those convinced IS survives on the kind of fanaticism that does not need to be bought, but this oversimplifies the nature of IS, which is not merely a collection of ideological diehards.It's easy to forget that in addition to its dedicated Islamists, IS is a home for sizeable chunk of Saddam Hussein's men who, after the United States invasion, found themselves excluded from the new Iraqi government and with nowhere to take their (often brutal) skills. The Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, formed alliances with many of them while he was in prison. Indeed IS probably couldn't exist without their expertise, acquired over years working for Saddam. Not so very long ago, these people were secularists – more particularly, Arab nationalists. For them, IS represents little more than a way back to power.Radical groups are often affected by impressively mundane factors. Al-Qaeda, for instance, suffered infighting and resignations when Ayman al-Zawahiri (then Osama bin Laden's deputy) halved salaries and ordered his followers to cease spending on anything that was not an emergency. Members complained of being given only $30 a month to pay for housing, or of being driven broke. Another felt so aggrieved, he embezzled tens of thousands of dollars.Beneath the austere, self-consciously pious veneer of such organisations is something far more ramshackle – susceptible to the same power plays and jealousies as, say, any political party. That's why IS so pointedly insisted its pay cut would apply to everyone without exception, "whatever his position". It fears some manner of rebellion if more senior fighters are seen to receive favourable treatment.This underscores perhaps the most important truth of IS: that it ultimately succeeds or fails for political reasons. Its support depends upon its ability to present itself as the only viable alternative for Sunni Muslims in the region. It so infamously took Mosul in 2014 because that city's Sunnis simply declined to put up a fight. They feared Iraq's Shia death squads more and saw the Iraqi government in Baghdad as a force for sectarian repression. IS, which promised to slaughter the Shia, seemed preferable to Sunnis than the Iraqi government, which promised to watch while militias slaughtered them.So when IS docks people's pay, it matters because it signals its weakness and damages its claims to being able to protect Sunnis. And in crassly commercial terms, it makes its offer to prospective members less compelling. In this respect at least, the US-led airstrikes are working.But in other important ways, they aren't. Around the time IS made this decision, the Washington Institute published a remarkable opinion poll of people living under IS in Mosul. The results show that although a majority would like IS to leave Mosul, and declare that IS is not representative of their views, support for IS has grown markedly in the past six months or so. More than half now say their lives have improved since IS took control. In June last year that figure was only 21 per cent.Meanwhile, about 40 per cent now say IS reflects their views and interests: a 400 per cent increase since June. It's unlikely these figures are entirely accurate, but the trend is clear.And it's also clear why. Of those who would prefer IS to stay in Mosul (39 per cent), only a third actually support them. The rest simply distrust the US, the Iraqi government or Kurdish militias too much. More people now regard US air strikes as the biggest threat to their family's security than see IS the same way, and a large majority are also worried about Shia militias. Put simply, the people of Mosul feel trapped. Unable to trust the Iraq government, and terrified of both American air strikes and Shia militias, they are more or less back where they were 18 months ago when ISIS rolled into town: sizing ISIS up as the least worst option.Put simply, in the most predictable way the military campaign is making IS more popular among those living under their control, at least in Mosul.That's what happens when military action is divorced from political strategy: your military gains develop a nasty habit of undoing themselves. US President Obama intuits this, hence his recent State of the Union exasperation: "Our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians".But it's unclear precisely what more the US-led coalition had in mind when it commenced this campaign. That's a problem apparently Malcolm Turnbull comprehends as he attempts to withstand subversive pressure from his own party to throw more soldiers into the Middle East.But there seems sadly little urgency in fleshing this out. Amid the sporadic debates about increasing our military involvement – amid the Palinesque outbursts, the Trumpian bravado and the more subtle provocations of the Abbott faction – it's as though we've forgot to debate our political strategy: how we'll win the trust of the Sunnis living under the IS neo-Jacobin regime; how the inevitable contests for control of this land will be resolved; and what exactly will hold a post-IS region together.These aren't luxurious, esoteric considerations that follow the "real" issue of our military involvement. They're the very guts of the issue. And if you're going to argue for expanded war, the price of admission should be nothing less than an argument with the politics fully considered. If only those who refused to pay it could have their salaries halved.
**********Attacks by Tony Abbott, Donald Trump: Arch conservatives offer nothing but guff********December 10, 2015******492**** Sorry, but I just can't quite get over the irony. Unless I have this completely mistaken, Tony Abbott just called for both a Reformation and a revolution "within Islam". This is, of course, perhaps the most well-worn and ill-informed cliche of Western discourse on Islam – the kind of thing people like to say when they want to sound serious but know almost exactly nothing about Islam, Muslim societies, or indeed the Reformation.But it takes on a special instructive quality coming from Abbott: a self-described conservative Catholic. If that description has an antonym, it's something like a revolutionary Protestant: pro-Reformation, pro-revolution. And yet here is our former prime minister, arguing against his very self.Unless, of course, he isn't because when it comes to Islam, all the normal rules are suspended. Including, it seems, whatever rules require that the words we use are meant to have meaning. So much could be said here. Of how Islam's own version of the Reformation already occurred in the 18th century. Of how this episode gave birth to Wahhabism, with its disdain for traditional religion and its austere scripturalism. Of how that finally became expressed in the nation state of Saudi Arabia. Of how it combined with the anti-colonial movement of Islamism – self-consciously a reform movement, by the way – to create (eventually) al-Qaeda and through it Islamic State. And of how we should hardly be surprised that Islam's Reformation has turned so bloody and so ugly given that Christianity's Reformation claimed somewhere between 5 million and 15 million lives in the French Wars of Religion and the Thirty Years' War alone.What Abbott (and new MP Andrew Hastie, and Energy and Resources Minister Josh Frydenberg – hell, you can add names of your own to the list) simply fail to understand is that the Reformation is here. They're looking at it. The Muslim world – and indeed Islamic thought – is in crisis. It has been probably since the late Ottoman era, and it was compounded by the utter destruction of its main institutions of religious learning in the colonial era. But its affliction has nothing to do with needing a Reformation. It's about a people now thoroughly disconnected from their own tradition. The Muslim world's affliction is amnesia.I could go on like this (and I have), but the truth is there's no point. Because this isn't really a conversation about Islam. It's too transparently political – and theologically illiterate – for that. The more interesting story here is one of a collapsing brand of politics; a politics compulsively lashing out as it becomes ever more marginal. Indeed a politics that seems to be taking pride in that marginality. Hereabouts, I give you Donald Trump."We need a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States while we figure out what the hell is going on," Trump boomed this week. It's a fascinating intervention because it's so completely unvarnished, but it's also the logical extension of all this Reformation guff.If the problem is an un-Reformed Islam then it follows that un-Reformed Muslims are intrinsically a danger. And if that Reformation has never existed, then it follows that all Muslims (or religious ones, anyway) are un-Reformed. Follow the syllogism and you'll get to Trump eventually. And that's where the brand of politics comes into focus. Trump hates Muslims, and clearly trades on it.But he apparently also hates Mexicans and women. Moreover, he hates them all in the most scandalous way, and I suspect that's the point. Trump is interesting precisely because his politics is all about scandal. He's transforming rank prejudice into virtue. Any scandal only proves his bona fides. So every criticism becomes just another case of political correctness to which he can respond, as he did this week: "But. I. Don't. Care."It's the not caring that is thrilling. Just as for Abbott, it's the "straight talking" that is the brand: "We can't remain in denial" he writes because it allows him to cast himself as clear-eyed and brave rather than historically loose and analytically incoherent. This is the politics of hairy chests; the politics that self-consciously gives the finger to the niceties of postmodern society. And especially, the politics that holds the full range of shadowy threats at bay – from Muslims to the PC brigade. Islam is just another symbol in this world; just another enemy of the imperilled order. It signifies the West's cultural decline: its capitulation to the cult of diversity and minority rights.The politics that (inaccurately) describes itself as conservative has now been reduced to such obsessions. It pretends to preserve and defend a culture, but notice how it never really enacts it. There is always much talk of values such as "decency and tolerance", but it's a real struggle to recall exactly how that was practised at crucial moments or under any stress. On climate change, or asylum seekers, or budget reform or international relations, the message was always one of aggression.The Abbott government – and now what we might call the Abbott opposition – was forever hunting enemies. At most it packaged aggression as compassion, but it was always aggression. That is the only mode it has. It has no traditional moral language; nothing that richly evokes concepts like empathy, courage, sacrifice, restraint, forgiveness, forbearance, humility.The real giveaway in this brand of politics is not that it speaks forthrightly about Islam. It's that it seems to be able to do nothing else (or maybe little else once you add the formulaic hectoring of climate change). It's the kind of discourse that has nothing much to say even about Christmas unless it can become a story of how political correctness (or Muslims, or both) are destroying it.I don't doubt this serves a purpose. I don't doubt Trump appeals to a sector of society that feels utterly excluded by the hyper-diversity of our age. I understand – and am even sympathetic to – the now hopeless desire for some kind of cultural consensus that can bind a society.But it is telling that self-described conservative politics cannot offer even that any more; that it can only offer a parade of enemies by way of substitute; that it simply cannot tap into a positive register. It's as though it has forgotten itself. As though it has suffered through its own unfortunate Reformation.
**********Islamic State is a bit player in a much bigger fight********November 26, 2015******288**** Amid the relentless focus of this past fortnight, it was possible to believe in a global consensus on the fundamental importance of destroying Islamic State. Putin and Obama reconciled enough to confer earnestly, while France simply khakied up and pounded Raqqa. But then Turkey shot a Russian plane out of the sky and reminded us of the complexities of this mess.The Middle East has now become the political equivalent of an Escher drawing; a canvas on which irreconcilable perspectives gather, and where everything is more important than everything else.The perhaps shocking fact is that IS exists only by indulgence. The indulgence, in the first place, of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad who responded to IS's arrival in Syria with acquiescence. It's easy to forget that back in 2011, as the Arab uprisings rounded on Assad, he dismissed his protesters as terrorists and foreign agents as a way of justifying his brutal response, and convincing the world to leave him in power.At the time this was bollocks – little more than a page spoken verbatim from the dictator's playbook. But over time IS became a prize gift. Much of its violence was directed not at Assad, but at the Syrian opposition who had taken control of Raqqa. In fear, many of them ended up joining IS, and IS eventually took hold of the city Assad had lost anyway. Until 2013 IS and Assad were content to play wide of each other in what David Kilcullen recently described as "a de facto truce". In short, IS made Assad's lie come true.The indulgence, too, of Iraq. This is not to deny the rude shock last year when IS screamed onto the world stage by taking Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. But Iraq as we knew it no longer exists. The north, which IS controls, is a different country now. The Sunnis living there have little desire to be part of what they consider to be a repressively Shiite state governed from Baghdad, and the southern Shiites seem equally content to cut the Sunnis loose.We don't talk much about Baghdad any more, partly because life is more normal and mundane there than it has been in years. Investment is up, and suicide bombing is down. Television airs sitcoms ridiculing IS and pop songs do the same. As Nicolas Pelham recently wrote in The New York Review of Books, southern Iraqis talk about IS in the past tense. Even if the Iraqi state could launch some military assault on the north, you get the distinct impression it couldn't be bothered.Then there's the indulgence of Turkey, which was happy to let Sunni terrorists pour over its border into Syria for years when IS was just a lad. Here, Turkey had two interests. First, to facilitate any opposition to Assad that it could. And second, to ensure its Kurdish population couldn't use the chaos to establish their own proto-state. Turkey is now a mirror image of Russia: a proud, once-imperial nation led by a macho aggressor determined to entrench its interests, subdue its separatists and act on behalf of its ethnic brethren.So, as Russia nicked Crimea off Ukraine in the name of protecting the Russian-speaking population, so too is Turkey enraged at Russia's air strikes on Syria which drop bombs on ethnic Turkmen. Russia, meanwhile, cheerfully bombs anyone opposed to Assad as a way to preserve him and maintain its own regional power. So for Putin, IS is simply convenient rhetorical cover that allows him to bomb whoever stands in Assad's way.No one likes IS, but everyone ultimately has greater, conflicting concerns. Partly that's because most nations recognise IS has no air force, no history of military victories against capable enemies and controls a largely empty swath of land, which it has recently commenced losing. Western nations might be keen to see that process complete itself, but the truth is they have little appetite for making it happen.Western populations have tired of war – a fact reflected in an Essential poll this week revealing that even so soon after Paris, fewer than a third of Australians want to see us step up our military involvement. But even more seriously, there's the stench of futility here. That same poll has only 17 per cent of us believing it would even make us safer if we did, and 45 per cent believing the opposite.That's why it's hard to see us rushing into a full-scale war. Sure, we could crush IS, but what then? Would we end up delivering land to the Kurds, and enraging Turkey? Or back to Assad, which would bolster Russia's power and entrench a dictator whose own body count simply dwarfs IS's? And what of the far likelier result that the land ends up contested by scores of warring groups engaged in an encore performance of the carnage in Iraq that gave birth to IS in the first place?In the visceral urge to smash things after Paris, you can overlook the fact that whenever we've tried to use our armies to smash terrorism we've generally scattered it all over the world. Remember when US president George W. Bush said we were fighting terrorists in Baghdad so we wouldn't have to fight them in Boston? And remember how, not so long ago, bombs went off in Boston? The idea that we can gather terrorism in one place and then destroy it is now surely one of the most demonstrably wrongheaded of our age.It takes a special kind of ideologically induced amnesia to ignore all this. It's an amnesia that takes centre stage in the American Republican party and the lunatic fringe of our own Coalition. But if Malcolm Turnbull is to be believed, this amnesia is not taking hold of Western leaders more generally. That's because they understand IS isn't a player. It's the Middle East's illegitimate child: a byproduct of the power vacuums of a broken region. It exists because it gets lost amid the much bigger fights going on around it – you know, between armies that actually have planes to shoot down. And you can do what you will to IS. Until those bigger fights are somehow resolved, there will always be a byproduct.
