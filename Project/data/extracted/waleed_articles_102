**********Without reforms, who will leash the media?********March 22, 2013******21**** What happens to media reform now? The government, having declared the urgency of its reform package, has promptly dumped it in an admission of defeat. It's a story of such political mishandling that it undermined a sitting prime minister. But it's also the story of a diabolical policy problem that might now never be solved in this country. Given the potency of the issue, it is worth considering why it's so thorny.A good starting point is to note that the story that set this issue alight - that Britain's News of the World had hacked into a murdered schoolgirl's phone and deleted voicemail messages, giving her friends and family false hope she was alive - was incorrect. The hacking happened, but the most outrageous part of the story didn't: the messages were probably deleted automatically. Five months after The Guardian broke the original story, it published a colossal correction notice.And yet, by then the damage was done. The Leveson inquiry was well under way. News of the World had been shut down after 168 years. The schoolgirl's family had been offered £2 million in compensation. Former editor Rebekah Brooks quit as chief executive of News International. And a process of serial embarrassment of politicians, executives and police, fuelled by public outrage, had such momentum that no correction could have stopped it.It's a richly ironic study in media accuracy, power and accountability. This incorrect report blew the lid off a much greater truth: that illegal phone hacking was rampant in News Corporation's British tabloids. It triggered Britain's grandest interrogation of media standards, yet the report would surely have breached those standards itself. Moreover, it shows just how much irreversible damage an inaccurate media report can do. It therefore symbolises the fundamental importance of a free media at the same time as it provides a powerful case for media regulation.This week, Britain reached its political conclusion. The three major parties agree on a tough new regime, creating an independent regulator with the power to impose fines of up to £1 million. The scheme is voluntary, but media organisations that don't sign up will have to pay greater compensation to any victims who successfully sue them than those who do. Media organisations are predictably upset, decrying this as political interference in journalism. The press holds politicians to account, but not, apparently, the other way around. Several publications, including The Daily Telegraph and The Spectator are threatening to boycott the regime.This neatly captures the paradox at the heart of media regulation. Repeated, serious breaches of journalistic standards mean we cannot trust media with the awesome power they have, and yet we can't trust anyone with the power to hold them seriously accountable, either. Everyone is conflicted here. Both the media and the political class have their own interests in this game. And yet the one interest that counts - the public interest - goes unrepresented.The result is a vacuum that allows each protagonist to pretend their own self-interest is really the public's. In the case of politicians, the conflict of interest, and the suspicion we should have of their motives, is obvious. But the media's argument is no less self-serving. By framing the entire issue as one of free speech, the media positions itself as the defender of an inviolable principle. But you won't hear media companies discuss how their commercial interests might compromise free speech as a matter of routine. We'll never know, for instance, how many bad news stories about a major sponsor have been buried. Whose interests does that serve?So let's think this through from first principles. Free speech is fundamental to democracy because it allows competing views to be tested against each other in the ''marketplace of ideas''. This helps citizens understand the pros and cons of the ideas on which they will ultimately vote. But that's not merely an argument for press freedom. It's also an argument for press responsibility. After all, the free market analogy only works if you import the assumptions on which the free market is based - chief among them that consumers have access to perfect information in making their choices.That's the media's role. Unfortunately, we in the media are in no position to claim we fulfil it. Not while fabricating stories that Australia's leading male television presenters are ''united'' in their ''concerns about the government's controversial media reforms''. That's flat out market distortion. It's the media equivalent of misleading and deceptive conduct.And right now, it happens pretty much without consequence beyond the odd apology. Even the argument that media outlets will be punished for such conduct by disgruntled customers doesn't remedy the situation. Australia's media ownership is so narrow, and competition so scarce, that there's little scope for the market to uphold standards. And in any event, there's little evidence to suggest trust equals audience size. So, what exactly is the mechanism for accountability?This, it seems to me, is the crux of the issue. Media self-regulation fails, not because it produces lax codes of conduct, or because those codes aren't applied. It fails because it doesn't matter if they are. The Press Council, for instance, has no power to order fines or compensation. In fact, it can't order anything - even something as pedestrian as an apology or correction. It can merely call for one. It is therefore subordinate to its members, who can choose to ignore it, or even hold it to ransom by threatening to withdraw funding. Often its members play nicely, but sometimes they don't. Fancy being able to opt out when you don't like the umpire's decision. All this combines to make media among the most unaccountable industries we have. The only breaches to be met with force are those serious enough to involve the courts. See Britain.Perhaps, then, this week's ultimately fatal entanglement over the government's Public Interest Media Advocate might have been avoided. A potent Press Council, with the power to impose real penalties, might just have been effective enough. Sure, that leaves open lots of questions about which penalties should apply when. But those questions are surely easier to resolve than the paradox of a political class setting the rules that govern its adversary.Age columnist Waleed Aly lectures in politics at Monash University.
