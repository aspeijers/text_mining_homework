**********Rhetoric of Tony Abbott and Tony Blair is morally bereft********October 30, 2015******628**** There's something about seeing a former prime minister attempting to defend or rehabilitate a legacy. Something about the relentless grinding out of well-rehearsed arguments in the hope that this time they will finally strike the audience, like some revelatory lightning bolt. But the result is so often perverse; every re-statement, every elaboration seems only to heighten the sense of parody, revealing anew why there's a legacy in need of rehabilitation.It's a spectacle we've witnessed twice this week in the forms of Tony Blair and Tony Abbott. To be sure, there are differences. Blair's intervention took the form of an apology; Abbott's a kind of unapology. Blair is apparently pre-empting the impending result of an almost certainly damning inquiry; Abbott is tending to his fresh wounds for his own reasons, rather than because of some urgent external demand. But at bottom, both men carry an albatross: in Blair's case a catastrophic foreign policy blunder, and in Abbott's case a thoroughgoing political failure."I can say that I apologise for the fact that the intelligence we received was wrong," began Blair when asked – again – about his decision to invade Iraq. Immediately he revealed what sort of an apology this wasn't, apologising for the most passive thing imaginable: receiving something. "Sorry, MI6 stuffed up", is the most direct translation.Elsewhere, he admitted to "mistakes in planning and, certainly, our mistake in our understanding of what would happen once you removed the regime". But even so, he remained resolutely unapologetic for "removing Saddam" on the basis that "today, in 2015, it is better that he's not there than that he is there". All of which raises the question: why, then, are you apologising?These "mistakes" and "misunderstandings" are doing an awesome amount of heavy lifting here. To begin with, they're lifting the hundreds of thousands of bodies that belong to dead Iraqi civilians and, of course, coalition soldiers. They're also lifting the burden of IS (which Blair accepts is, at least in part, a creation of the Iraq invasion) and the increased regional influence of Iran. Frankly, it's a hell of a whoopsie. Too big, really, to explain how such a momentous decision was made on such inadequate intelligence, and certainly too big to explain how so much expert advice to the contrary was so gleefully ignored.But a whoopsie it simply must be because it's the only way Blair can keep any semblance of his legacy intact. The alternative is to admit the more grotesque allegations against him: that he either lied or manipulated his way into a predictably disastrous war, sacrificing countless lives in the process (literally – we refuse to count them). So, to admit to certain well-intentioned mistakes, and apologise for the failures of other people, is really to change the subject. Blair's aim here is not to come clean, but to wash away the intractable moral questions that will forever plague him.Abbott's Margaret Thatcher Lecture seems to present an opposite problem. In spruiking his asylum seekers policies to the world, he's not rehashing a losing argument, but perhaps his only winning one. And yet Abbott's speech, by taking those policies beyond the parochial outpost of Australia and thrusting them before Europe, seems only to have exposed their limitations."The only way to dissuade people seeking to come from afar is not to let them in," he declared as thousands fleeing the civil war in Syria flood into Europe. Anything less than turning boats around would make Europe "a facilitator rather than a deterrent" of people smuggling.But there's a reason this argument, which is utterly mainstream in Australia, tends only to win fans like UKIP's Nigel Farage in Britain. What it offers is not a solution at all, but instead a determination to opt out of a solution. That much becomes clear when you think through the implications of Abbott's prescription.European turnbacks could only mean millions of people piling up in places like Lebanon and Turkey. Indeed, the basis of Abbott's argument is that these people reach Europe via other countries to which they've already fled, and are therefore, by definition, economic migrants rather than refugees fleeing a war zone.But unless Abbott wants to argue explicitly that the burden of the Syrian catastrophe must fall disproportionately on these countries, they remain just as sovereign as us, and can therefore assert a right to seal their own borders, too In fact, every nation can make a similar claim, leaving only one ultimate consequence: that those fleeing Syria are hemmed right back into the war zone they're fleeing.That makes the ultimate mockery of any "deaths at sea" reasoning. But it also raises one of the most ignored questions in the asylum-seeker drama: why should the weight of refugee protection be carried by those nations least equipped to handle it? How is it a moral result that Lebanon takes something equivalent to a quarter of its population, while Australia congratulates itself for taking 12,000 people? How is it "heroic" (to borrow Farage's assessment) to advocate that instead of nations like ours doing something more proportionate, Europe simply lock its gates and let the human debris fall where it may?The answer lies somewhere in Abbott's warning of a "tide of humanity surging through Europe and quite possibly changing it forever". Whether such numbers will change, say, Turkey in a similar way is unanswered and, it seems, irrelevant. And if that's so, we're left with the clear implication that only Europe (and, I suppose, Australia) is worthy of such preservation.That's the kind of conclusion you tend to reach when your response is really to shift the problem elsewhere. And that kind of reasoning seems solid on an island like ours with a political culture that mostly ignores arcane matters like foreign affairs.But it's also the kind of conclusion you reach when, deep down, the actual lives of people in far off lands barely feature in your moral calculus. And that way lies just about every transgression for which you'll never feel any need to apologise. Even, say, the most scantily justified war.
**********Doctors' protest over asylum seekers shows us what real morality is all about********October 15, 2015******186**** It's easy to forget there was a time that we didn't justify our asylum seeker policies by claiming they were "stopping deaths at sea". Once upon the Howard era, we were candid enough to say flat out it was a bald assertion of sovereignty, bolstered by a general hunch we didn't really like these people very much. That's what the whole "children overboard" thing was about, really: one final overstatement in a relentlessly prosecuted argument that boat people weren't really people at all. Hence: queue jumpers, possibly terrorists, the kind of unscrupulous cynics who'd drop their own kids in the ocean if it helped them cheat their way in.Viewed through that history we can see just how remarkable the transformation has been. "Deaths at sea" allowed us to take a crassly nationalistic argument and turn it instead into a moral one. The odd "economic refugees" or "Christians only" snipe aside, we stopped attacking refugees directly and attacked people smugglers instead. Brutality was transformed into a kind of muscular compassion, and every confirmation of the psychological (and sometimes physical) destruction of people under our jurisdiction was rendered a sober necessity. Deterrence, no matter what horrors it entailed, became the only moral position. That, insisted Malcolm Turnbull this week, is "the melancholy truth".And it is precisely this that makes the current refusal of doctors at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital to discharge their asylum-seeker patients if they are to be returned to immigration detention so potent. In a debate that is so constant and repetitive it has become mere auditory wallpaper, theirs is the most disruptive intervention in years. And that's because it is so explicitly not political. This is ostensibly a clinical decision: doctors insisting detention would further damage those under their care, and who are therefore bound not to subject them to it. But beneath every clinical judgment lies an ethical one, too. That's why doctors swear oaths. Medicine is more than a technocratic application of treatments; it is the practice of an ethos of service and care. When doctors declare they cannot return patients to immigration detention, they are saying it would be immoral for them to do so: a violation of their covenant.Government policy cannot simply trump such oaths. It cannot erase the age-old ethical foundations of an entire profession. And that is why the doctors' stance is so impervious to the predictable retorts of politics. No amount of invoking "deaths at sea" can compel a doctor to harm her patient. We're witnessing two contrasting moral languages here that proceed from different assumptions of what constitutes the good. And there's a lot we can learn from identifying those differences.The doctors' moral focus is on the individual patient. They do not ask, for example, whether that patient is worthy of treatment. They don't give less care to an abusive drunkard than to an altruistic social worker. They don't refuse to treat an elderly patient simply because it might be more productive to prioritise treating younger people with their prime decades still in front of them. They reject any notion that a "lesser" person should be sacrificed for the benefit of someone – or something – "greater". Their morality is about the unquestioned dignity of the person before them; a dignity that exists for no reason other than that this is a human being in need of care. In this sense it has clear liberal (or perhaps personalist) overtones. And for that reason, it is far from niche. This idea – that each individual is sacred; that no individual can simply be sacrificed in order save others – lies at the heart of our civilisation. It's the reason we've prohibited torture. It's why we've abandoned the death penalty in this country, no matter the crime. Indeed, it's the basis of the whole idea of human rights, which this nation was so instrumental in distilling into law. It's meant to be the basis on which we do our public reasoning. So it's hugely significant that right now, it's also the opposite of the argument our politicians are running. "Deaths at sea" only masks the nature of the morality we're adopting here. So let's be clear what it ultimately means: that we sacrifice some people for the sake of others. That individual people will be brutalised and occasionally destroyed, so that others' lives may be saved. I cannot claim there's no moral case to be made to that effect at all (although I doubt the claim there is simply no other way to save these lives). It's just that it is a starkly utilitarian one: greatest good for the greatest number, and all that.That might be fine if it's a moral vision we habitually adopt, but it's not. We don't, say, force people to donate their organs, even though we know this would save lives. As a nation we've typically rejected this sort of approach because it has a nasty habit of being unprincipled. It's the morality that can make anything from slavery, to torture, to Stalinism possible: an ethos that has no rules, only results; where nothing has intrinsic value except whatever "greater good" you wish to serve. Under this sort of cover, almost any atrocity can be sanctified. And if it can do even that sort of heavy lifting, then what's the mental disintegration of a few hundred asylum seekers – whether they're children or not?That's how we've reached the point where we no longer even need to pretend our detention centres are anything other than (in Patrick McGorry's phrase) "factories for producing mental illness". We've developed a morality that can absorb that. We just can't recognise how dramatic that is because our political debate is incapable of teasing out the moral assumptions that made that possible. But every now and then something happens that reveals the smallness of politics. Perhaps we shouldn't be altogether surprised that this time it was the stand of a few Melbourne doctors. After all, they clearly understand the ethics on which their profession is based. And their clarity leaves us with the question of whether the rest of us can make anything like the same claim. 
**********Malcolm Turnbull’s first task: soothe the angry beast in the Liberal Party********September 18, 2015******362**** There's every chance you haven't heard of Zed Seselja. For the record, he's the Liberal senator for the ACT who this week warned his new boss, Malcolm Turnbull, that the Liberal Party is "a predominantly conservative party", and that this must be reflected in his first ministry. This, quite pointedly, sits at odds with Turnbull's own promise in the immediate afterglow of victory to lead a "thoroughly liberal government".It is true that with Turnbull's ascent we might be witnessing the rescue of this Coalition government's political fortunes. But we're also now seeing its first civil war. Turnbull's success depends on how bloody that conflict becomes and how many wounds he suffers, and not on anything Labor can muster. The early signs aren't great. Slowly, we're learning of the continuing anger towards Christopher Pyne, Julie Bishop and even Scott Morrison over their abandonment of Tony Abbott. We're discovering Cory Bernardi's remarkable flirtation with leaving the Liberal Party altogether, perhaps with a view to establishing his own neo-Hansonite operation.Then there are the incandescent interventions of Alan Jones types that agitate the kind of base Bernardi might pilfer. Part of this undoubtedly stems from a deeply held hatred of Turnbull – of his broadly liberal politics and his swift dismissal of their obsessions, such as climate-change denial. Part of it is the visceral contest for a great party's soul.But perhaps, most seriously, this is the desperate gasp of a certain politics in crisis, demonstrably failing and on the brink of redundancy.Abbott's demise represents not merely the fall of a politician, but of a world view.Who will represent Australian neo-conservatives now? Those expressing such concerns overlook the most important fact – that it is these people who have had the keys to the kingdom for the past two years, only to see the palace crash down around them. . It is hard to imagine a government that could better approximate the values espoused by Sydney shock jock Ray Hadley. And yet in less than 18 months it faced a leadership spill, reflecting its status as the most rapidly despised government in memory – even when confronted by a limp opposition.In this time it has been the mainstream that has gone unrepresented, while the government went on niche excursions into battle with, say, renewable energy.That, largely, is why Turnbull is popular. He seems to grasp the broad sense of what the centre wants, and has the ability to talk about it.That is only true because Australia is a rapidly transforming society. The centre now is simply not where it was in the John Howard era. Sure, Abbott lacked Howard's subtlety and grasp of middle Australia. But Abbott also governed a different country, one whose cultural politics had become effortlessly more cosmopolitan and liberal.We see this in the easy acceptance of something like same-sex marriage, which was positively, radically unthinkable in Howard's time.This means Howard's mix of neo-liberal economics and nationalist cultural politics no longer works. In the aftermath of 9/11 and the ructions of Pauline Hanson, you could pretend that the world was being ruined by politically correct elites, the ABC, multiculturalism, greenies, and migrants who refuse to integrate.Howard famously predicted the times would suit him, and they did. But those times began to end around 2006 and have only receded further into history. Nowadays that sort of argument sounds like an artefact. What once was populist has slowly become marginal – the kind of thing you'd go to a Reclaim Australia rally to hear.Unfortunately for Abbott, if he went to such a rally he'd have found one of his own MPs speaking at it. And he'd have no answer to this because it is on such fringes that he and his cheerleaders increasingly found themselves.They would dispute this, of course. Hence the continued misdiagnoses of the problem, from the constant references to a "feral" Senate right down to Abbott's final prime ministerial moments in which he blamed a febrile media for his plight.He's not completely wrong, to be fair. Our public culture surely has become as abrasive as it has become shallow. But it is not this that did for Abbott, so much as his disastrous first budget and its manifestly unfair distribution of pain; his mass of contradictory (and accordingly broken) promises; his campaign on racial vilification laws; his economically backward-looking love of coal; and symbolically backward-looking knighting of Prince Philip.From there, every move he made, particularly in a neo-conservative direction, alienated and occasionally offended the electorate, reinforcing the perception he was not merely idiosyncratic, but belligerently so.Every politics runs its course until its moment of crisis. For Labor it was in the aftermath of the Hawke/Keating reforms when the new consensus on liberal economics buried the Labor Party's reason for existence – a reason it has not yet rediscovered. Now it is neo-conservatism's turn.Left unchecked as it has been in Britain and New Zealand, this eventually takes the form of Donald Trump, offering nothing more than the celebration of naked prejudice as some kind of virtue. It will have its moments of frenzy, but not its lasting victories, and certainly not any proud legacy.Australia is a long way from there. The Liberal Party is not yet overrun. But even so, it is deeply unrepresentative. Turnbull is its most representative figure, and for that very reason is perhaps its most internally despised.His task is to narrow that gap; to make his party mainstream and electable. And perhaps that is not beyond him. Unlike Labor, the Liberal Party loves success and tends to mould itself to the personality of its leader. But he'll want to succeed because if he can't drag this government somewhere central, this government could well drag him into oblivion.
**********Dyson Heydon: the pub test is a tool in the politics of cynicism********September 4, 2015******200**** Can we just kill the pub test? Can we banish it from whatever this thing is that masquerades as political debate? For starters, it's never clear what kind of pub we're talking about. One of those groovy inner-city ones populated by kale-fuelled hipsters? One of those (increasingly rare) suburban ones that swallowed a bistro back in the '80s and is now kept afloat by pokies? One of those pillar-of-the-community ones in the country, across the road from the church and the footy ground?It kind of matters because each of these captures different social sets, with different worldly concerns and different levels of interest in politics. That's why I have this sneaky feeling the people who talk about the "pub test" are usually people who never actually go to pubs unless there's some magnetic photo opportunity pulling them there.This week, that apparently includes lots of people aghast that Dyson Heydon absolved himself of apprehended bias in his role running the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption.Indeed, it has become a concerted line of attack. Here's Adam Bandt: "Agreeing to attend a Liberal fundraiser doesn't pass the pub test. The commissioner deciding himself that he's not biased won't change that". Or the ACTU's Dave Oliver who declared the whole episode wouldn't be accepted by "too many people now in the pub … or out in the street".OK, fine. But so what? When Heydon was ruling on apprehensions of his own bias, he was answering a legal question. He was parsing lots of quite technical legal principles and applying the facts in this case to them. And here's the thing: when it comes to developing and applying the legal principles that govern the administration of justice, I frankly don't want that done in pubs. I think we can do better than some version of trial by talkback. I'm content to let such things be determined by the accumulated jurisprudential wisdom of centuries. I'm happy for judges to stand apart from the bar-room banter, rather than be besieged by it.Sure, the law has its flaws, and judicial processes occasionally fail. It was, after all, a court that so egregiously convicted Lindy Chamberlain. But show me a single pub in Australia that wouldn't have done the same, and then cheerfully gone on to repeat similar injustices in scores of other cases.This isn't a mere question of semantics. Let's be clear about this: when Bandt or Oliver appeal to pub sensibilities to suggest it is some obvious howler that Heydon would hear an application against himself, they are in fact attacking the normal operation of the legal system. In making his judgment, Heydon was acting as countless judges have for countless years. As you read this right now, there's a fair chance a judge somewhere in Australia is doing the same in a very important case involving lots of money or the fate of some children after a divorce.Sure, there are critiques of this process, but if we're going to make them, let's own up to what that means: a thoroughgoing legal reform that has nothing particularly to do with Heydon. Let us declare this long-established feature of our legal system unacceptable, outline what legal changes we would make, and demonstrate why they are necessary. Otherwise, we're left with what the "pub test" always is: a crafted, folksy, political talking point deployed for political convenience.Perhaps, then, we should simply dismiss it as a rhetorical flourish. And I would if this were an isolated case. But it's not. In fact it's becoming a touchstone of our political conversation. It was applied to Bill Shorten when he fronted the same royal commission to explain some apparently suspicious payments his union received from companies years ago. It was applied – with a little help from Joe Hockey – to Bronwyn Bishop's surreal chopper excursion, and then to every story of a politician's family flying business class. Alan Jones used it to savage the Abbott government's free trade agreement with China. Try it: punch a politician's name into Google along with "pub test".What, exactly, is being denoted here? The kindest answer would be some sense of "real" politics as understood by "real" people, rather than the insincere, manufactured stuff offered by professional politicians. There's a certain nobility to this idea – a sense that politics should include the ordinary among us and not merely be the preserve of a self-serving, self-referential elite.But there's an illusion to it, too. Because just as the pub is no longer a single coherent idea, neither are real people. All real people can quickly be broken down into far narrower, less real subsets: greenies, rednecks, lefties, bogans, oldies, suits – we're all in one bubble or another, each of which is out of touch with everyone else. Anyone who says otherwise is a well-to-do, inner-city media editor pretending desperately to speak on behalf of middle Australia.But more likely – and especially where boring technical issues are concerned, like in Heydon's case – it denotes something worse. The patron that we would have standing in judgment of Heydon is not gathering all the available facts, poring over the evidence and then trying to form the most discerning possible view. They're riffing, really, probably on the basis of a news item or two.And law-reform debates aside, that's my fear: that "pub test" has simply become a shorthand for impressionistic politics – a politics of the gut. This is a politics of quick opinion, unconcerned with details or abstract principles. I don't deny such politics exist. I don't even argue they shouldn't. But there are surely times when appealing to this is just too cynical; when it subverts a process that is specifically meant to be independent of pub politics.I think this is one of them. Not because Heydon's perceived impartiality is beyond any reasonable challenge. For what it's worth, I have my doubts about parts of his decision simply denying the relevant function was a fundraiser. And I suspect he too easily dismissed the clearly political dynamics driving this royal commission.But, frankly, my doubts aren't worth a coaster. If the unions are as scandalised as they say, I'd encourage them to head to court immediately and mount a challenge. I'd like to see them chance their arm outside the pub. Because I'd hate to think they're content to let Heydon's decision stand so they can play it for politics.
**********Abbott is losing the plot in his war on environmentalists********August 21, 2015******715**** Few things seem to rile the Abbott government quite as much as isolated Federal Court decisions. You'll recall that before this whole Carmichael coal mine episode there was Andrew Bolt's section 18C affair. Tony Abbott was in opposition in that case, but this difference aside, the similarities are striking.In both cases, the good guys lost. In both cases, they were the victims of pesky activist types. And in both cases the laws in question had been in force for some 15 or so years, having barely been used with any success.And yet, in both cases, the Coalition's response has been to declare – on the basis of little more than one result it didn't like – that the laws in question were wreaking some manner of tyrannical havoc and had to be junked. If that strikes you as a little rash, the section 18C experience supports your hunch.Somehow the Abbott government convinced itself that its sense of outrage was a mainstream one: that the electorate would fete it as the heroic protector of an imperilled free speech, and some dangerously fading right to bigotry. Soon enough it became clear the public saw no such scandal, that it was the government's position that was on the margins, and that its 18C proposals would be forced to retreat to the shelves of political abandonment.But the fuming over Adani​'s Carmichael troubles might be even more rash. The laws in question are John Howard's. The idea that environmental groups can test governmental decisions in court is a markedly uncontroversial one because it recognises that environmental damage affects the whole country and cannot be confined merely to local landowners; and that if environmental protection is left only to individual locals, no meaningful environmental protection will take place.Sure, there's some chance such laws could be abused. Which is why the public service did a thorough review on how they've been working. Turns out they're working fine. "These provisions have created no difficulties and should be maintained," it concluded. "The question is whether these provisions should be expanded further." Hence, from 5500 projects, the laws have been used 33 times. Successfully, twice. That's a success rate of 0.04 per cent. Rounded up.Now, consider the government's language. It talks of "vigilante litigation", "endless legal sabotage", "bullies in the green movement" and an environmentalist "war against economic development". It is, of course gigantically hyperbolic. In the case of "vigilante litigation" it is literally nonsensical – like "gluttonous starvation" or "rapid-fire sluggishness". But it's also visceral in a way that is instructive. It suggests this is something more than garden variety politicking. There's a genuine, long-standing disdain here that has much to tell us about the current state of ostensibly conservative party politics.Much like section 18C, the Carmichael mine case taps into a much greater political mythology. These are not, in the Coalition's view, isolated cases at all. Rather, they are symbols of a more fundamental, thoroughgoing onslaught. Whether it be racial and ethnic minorities, or environmentalists, all are taken to be special interests whose claims threaten the liberal order of things. To resist these forces is therefore not to fix some mere technical flaw in this or that legislation. It is to defend the barricades against the evils of an unchecked collectivism that sits in direct contrast to our established capitalist ethos.That's why the Abbott government so consistently posits the environment and the economy as opposites, even as the governments of America, Britain, New Zealand, and (broadly) Europe, don't. For Abbott, the environment matters, but not at the expense of the economy, to which it is subordinate. Carbon pricing only ever costs jobs, rather than creates them. And, of course, environmental protection laws can only ever be "green tape": a regulatory yoke around the neck of business, and not a means of protecting valuable assets that return economic benefits in the long term.Implicit here: environmentalists, and environmentalism, are simply not to be trusted. Their very motives must be suspect. So, it's "war" and "sabotage" and "bullying" and nothing more genuine than that.The "new religion" of the "extreme left" is how former Coalition senator Nick Minchin put it: the cloak that masks its real agenda to "deindustralise the Western world". Environmentalism, then, becomes the new communism, designed to implement vast new bureaucracies that control the free market and implement the will of the unelected.You can see the ideological residue of the Cold War, here. And on one level, that makes sense. That was an era from which notionally conservative parties emerged ideologically triumphant, and in which the world accordingly made perfect sense. But as the Abbott government's woes suggest, things aren't so triumphant now. That world that made so much sense makes appreciably less sense now.Some conservative parties, such as the Tories in Britain, have made the ideological adjustment, embracing at least the idea of a conservative environmentalism. But in Australia, as for the Republicans in America, such adjustments are scant. We're apparently fixed on the same binaries even as we're faced with a world that increasingly defies them.That's why the government is compelled to overstate everything, from the amount of investment Adani is promising to the number of jobs the project is meant to create, to the scale of environmentalists' "very well orchestrated and highly funded campaign". It's why the issue must become the very idea of the law that requires a thorough environmental examination, rather than the government's failure in this case to follow it.And it's why the government, having swept to power opposing a carbon tax, somehow finds itself increasingly at odds with the electorate on renewable energy and, to a lesser extent, climate change. It seems determined to see environmentalist concerns as fringe and radical; as a valid object of war. But war has its osmosis. If you're not careful, you eventually become the very thing you thought you were fighting.
**********Tony Abbott has been further isolated by his Indigenous backdown********August 6, 2015******197**** It is a rare day you receive a letter from your own "prophet". And it is surely a rarer one when you reject it. But that's what happened this week when Tony Abbott rebuffed Noel Pearson's suggestion that the path to Indigenous constitutional recognition goes through Indigenous Australians.It's a simple idea, really: you can't come up with a form of recognition that will mean anything to Indigenous people until they have figured out exactly what that is themselves. The government needs to afford them the chance to thrash this out without the rest of us being in the room. So, Indigenous-only conferences – this is the kind of consultation Indigenous Australia is crying out for, and which is routinely denied.So it was again. "Madness", cried Pearson upon learning of the Prime Minister's rejection. Usually it's the prophet who wears such labels from a disbelieving public. So something is terribly amiss when he's flinging it at his disciple. And it's a madness made all the more befuddling when you consider Pearson developed this proposal with Patrick Dodson: two men who over decades have occupied distant poles within Indigenous affairs.There's Dodson the frequently revered elder, and Pearson the anti-welfare, free-marketeering lawyer, beloved of successive Coalition prime ministers. That they stand unified with a clear request on behalf of a people who exhibit the fractiousness so common among minority groups says this must be impossibly obvious. And yet. "It jars with the notion of finally substituting 'we' for 'us and them'," declared Abbott.  "It might produce something akin to a log of claims". If Pearson is offended – and he said as much this week – it's because the theme is about as old as it gets. It's the vision of an Indigenous Australia relentlessly making demands, seeking  rights the rest of us don't want to bear; an Indigenous Australia that can't be trusted to be consulted properly because it "will go completely feral", in Pearson's exasperated phrase. It's the logic that insists we are all simply citizens: individuals, the same and undifferentiated. This is a kind of pious liberalism that rigorously ignores entrenched disadvantage; the same one that is implicitly why John Howard refused what became Kevin Rudd's famous apology, and is explicitly why he rejected any suggestion of a treaty. The trouble is, it sits entirely at odds with the whole project of Indigenous recognition: a project Abbott has promised to "sweat blood" to achieve.What went wrong? The least charitable answer would be: nothing; that this is simply the logical extension of Abbott's entrenched world view. And maybe that's true. But it's also true that Abbott is rare among our politicians – and certainly our prime ministers – in his level of exposure to Indigenous Australia.Clearly, even by the testimony of the most sympathetic Indigenous leaders, he is failing on promise to be "a prime minister for Indigenous affairs": a failure written in harsh budget cuts to essential services and a seminal contribution to the possible forced closure of remote communities, even before you factor in a stalled recognition campaign.  But there's something in the fact that he thought to make the promise in the first place. A promise, after all, that would have earned him no points from his political base and could hardly have helped him on election day. Particularly when you consider how the 2013 Indigenous vote fled from him.I doubt Abbott would make such a promise now; it's just so at odds with the mode in which he's governing, which seems almost entirely directed at a different cause. Join the dots between his strange campaign against an extremely popular renewable energy industry, his slowly cooling war with the ABC and now this, and the image emerges of a prime minister governing for the farthest reaches of his own party.All these issues are ones in which Abbott finds himself almost determinedly outside the mainstream. The polling is clear. Even Coalition voters love renewable energy and trust the ABC. And if your approach to Indigenous affairs offends the very Indigenous voice who effectively wrote your pre-election policies, there is scarcely anyone left in Indigenous Australia on whose behalf you are governing.In this sense, the constitutional recognition campaign may be among the collateral damage of February's near-death experience. The 39 votes cast that day for no one, but against Abbott, clearly wounded. The shock has subordinated him to his backbench, several of whom would pull him only further from the electorate. Thus is Abbott marooned on issues like, say, same-sex marriage, where 80 per cent of his party room is against it, and 70 per cent of the electorate for it. That neatly captures the paradox. Abbott is on a constant quest to save his leadership, and in the process can only progressively weaken it.This is meant to be the lot of Labor prime ministers, beholden to factional shoving, vulnerable to self-centred forces that have little to do with the interests of the electorate. That it is now happening to a Liberal Prime Minister is quietly enormous. It is not meant to be this way. The Liberal Party is meant to be a creature of its leader; a more freeform arrangement that coalesces around success and the authority it confers. So it has been from Menzies to Howard, with only the most incompetent exceptions.Abbott might just be the Liberal Party's first Labor prime minister: gasping for authority, unable to rely on his instincts, consumed by a narrow brand of leadership for the benefit of his family's most idiosyncratic branches. That's why there's no coherence, only a rolling series of enemy targets and aborted policy missions. It's why even natural allies such as the business community are increasingly disillusioned. And it's why the clearer it is that Abbott is leader, the harder it is to tell exactly who he's leading.
**********Politics: the ugly game where the melee rules********July 23, 2015******169**** The NRL this week announced its rule changes for next season. The AFL will do that later, but for now its community is engrossed in a frenzied debate about what those changes should be. In both cases, though, the aim is clear: make it easier to score. Footballers in both codes are simply so fit, so disciplined now, they're defending too well. The game is clogged, rigid, structured. It's ugly. Fans are disillusioned. So, for example, both codes will likely reduce the number of substitutions in the hope of exhausting the players, cracking defences, and inviting a festival of tries and goals late in matches. That's a spectacle that will thrill us.What both codes know is that this cannot simply be left to the coaches. Their job is winning. It is not to make the game attractive. Every club would rather win ugly than lose pretty. And hereabouts a paradox emerges: your club's single-minded quest for success slowly erodes the game's appeal. The adversarial grammar of sport guarantees more professional performance, but not a more enjoyable product. So, at intermittent crisis points, the AFL and the NRL intervene, assuming their role as overarching custodians of the game.Politics, of course, has no equivalent of this. It is left entirely to its clubs, each of whom is similarly obsessed with the short-term pursuit of victory. In theory, an overarching concern with the good of the nation is meant to mitigate. But that requires us simply to trust our parties to subordinate themselves to this; to sacrifice cynical political opportunities for something greater. Right now, that trust seems thoroughly naive. Politics is at a point of crisis, where no short-term political opportunity can be passed up. And the end result has been the debasement of the whole endeavour of politics. The game's ugly.I could recite any number of examples to illustrate this. Like Labor's faux outrage on the fuel excise, which it irresponsibly slammed, then having extracted maximum populist mileage, quietly supported a year later. Or the Coalition's declaration that it was open to examining superannuation tax concessions, only to dismiss this altogether in a Tea Party-style rage the moment Labor dared to offer a suggestion. But such is our age that a new example is born every moment. And so, I give you Bronwyn Bishop.There's little disputing the offence here. Even Tony Abbott – a man intensely loyal to Bishop – has confirmed as much. There's also little disputing that the starring role of an indulgent chopper lends a surreal, satirical quality to the whole affair. So, too, that this is Bronnie – the woman who made a name for herself savaging others' misuse of public money. But all that said, we're not talking about high crime. In a normal world, this sort of thing is shoved off to some finance committee or other. But this is no longer a normal world. And so Labor's first instinct is to ask the federal police to get involved.That, of course, is retaliation for the sordid Peter Slipper affair. This is understandable, but it's also the point. The Abbott opposition's attack on Slipper – which resulted in criminal charges for misused cab charges that ultimately failed – was a nakedly political one. So, for that matter, was Labor's contrivance to put Slipper in the speaker's chair in the first place, handing the Gillard government an extra voting member in a hung Parliament. That was the story of a cut-throat Parliament in which the office of the speaker became a mere pawn. That is a serious erosion of a key institution of government. Bishop's continued partisanship – so strong that her greatest regret is that this saga has taken the heat off Bill Shorten – has only compounded the decline. But it is a decline that was already well in motion.We're playing politics by newly unvarnished rules now; a kind of total politics, where nothing has an existence beyond winning and losing. The disease extends even to royal commissions, like the one on pink batts, telling us nothing we didn't already know, but reminding the world of past Labor scandal. Should this become a pattern of partisan shaming of previous governments, our political culture will be truly lost.All this inevitably exacts its price in policy. Here, too, the week provides an example in Shorten's new proposed renewable energy target of 50 per cent by 2030. Bold. Ambitious. Etc. But the giveaway is Shorten's celebration of this as the "centrepiece of our response to climate change", promising he would refuse to buckle before "ridiculous scare campaigns" from the Coalition. But if Shorten means what he says, he's already buckled. The RET is not a centrepiece. It is rather a peripheral complement to the real centrepiece: an emissions trading scheme. And there's a very good reason for that: just about everyone agrees that the most efficient way to reduce carbon emissions is to use the market to do it by pricing carbon. To make the RET your centrepiece is to abandon the very idea of a market-centred approach in favour of using blunt regulation.Labor doesn't believe in that. At least, it has always said it doesn't. Its reason for making the RET central is simple: it's popular. Everyone loves renewable energy, even Coalition voters. But everyone's nervous about pricing carbon because Abbott so mercilessly slayed Labor with its carbon tax. Even now the Coalition is insisting there's no difference between a carbon tax and an emissions trading scheme (incidentally making John Howard the first prime minister to propose a carbon tax). If that's a "ridiculous scare campaign", then it seems very much to have intimidated Labor.It's a bizarre scene. The major parties – both of which heartily embraced free-market orthodoxy about 30 years ago – are now vying with each other to move the free market to the edges of their climate change policies. Labor's focus is apparently regulation. The Coalition has a centralised command and control policy it calls Direct Action, which sounds a bit like some radical socialist group that handed you pamphlets on campus. This is not the result of a policy debate. It's the accumulated effect of a series of small, short-term political manoeuvres that have left us with nowhere else to go; a steady stream of wins and losses being chalked on a board somewhere at club headquarters. Meanwhile, no one seems to care much for the state of the game. And hereabouts we learn politics and football aren't quite identical. Politics has no custodians. Apparently it is nowhere near as important.
**********Politics is about persuasion but both parties neglect the public's views********July 10, 2015******203**** About the same time Barnaby Joyce was not appearing on Q&A, Australians were largely not digesting an opinion poll from that morning that made diabolical reading. Most simply, it was diabolical for our major political leaders, both of whom are plumbing historic depths of unpopularity and disapproval.More broadly, though, this whole snapshot is diabolical for the very idea of Australian political culture. Our disillusionment with politics is now complete. It is real. It is not mere nostalgia for a better time that never existed. It is a kind of socialised disgust at the cynical offering with which voters are now stuck. Joyce's forced boycott (and now, Malcolm Turnbull's) partly explains this nadir.Not because democracy cannot function without Q&A, or even that Q&A cannot function without the Coalition. But because a cabinet boycott of this kind symbolises the state of civil debate in this country; a debate now so thoroughly decomposed it barely resembles its origins as the central pillar of democracy. This saga stands as an emblem for the way in which we do public discourse.Both major parties contribute to this mess, though in opposite ways. The Coalition pursues niche convictions that have little to do with public sentiment; Labor pursues public sentiment but with little conviction. What neither do is engage us on contentious matters of importance, and mount a coherent, sustained argument. They will try to outrage us – preferably directing that rage towards their foes. They will try to assuage us. But they almost never try to persuade us.To be sure, each party has its populist terrain, on which it naturally embodies public instincts. The Coalition has national security and boats. Labor has anything that can be dubbed "fairness" and (if the Coalition dares raise it) industrial relations. But so ingrained are our uninspiring habits that even on these issues there is nothing approximating leadership.Labor's best moments arrive when the Coalition steps on a landmine and offends the electorate. From here, Labor simply amplifies the damage. It does not start these conversations and take the country with it. It waits for the country to declare its outrage, then rides it. So it was with the Abbott government's disastrous first budget, as it was with WorkChoices before it. Where other issues fall its way – like say climate change or even same-sex marriage – it simply mangles the argument.It is Labor – through Kevin Rudd's ETS cowardice and Julia Gillard's "citizens' assembly" policy void, which led her ultimately to break her promise by negotiating a carbon tax she had specifically ruled out – that has made a serious climate change policy politically impossible. And when it does mount a visionary idea – like, say, Gonski – it fails to explain why these ideas are more important than the debt they will impose, leaving them susceptible to a fiscal dismantling.The Coalition, meanwhile, finds itself unable to resist overdoing its advantages. Tony Abbott's recently belligerent focus on national security has lacked any of John Howard's subtlety, and delivered no discernible benefit in the polls. He's pursued this so wildly that his most high-profile cabinet colleague – and greatest internal threat as leader – now feels comfortable building his capital by being more measured on terrorism. Abbott may be the first leader to have found a way to exhaust the political advantages of national security, which is no piffling achievement. The same is probably not quite true of asylum seeker policy, but the problem with boats is that once they stop coming, Australians stop fearing them, meaning their political bang has a natural limit. Unless, of course, the issue can be somehow revived.That thought petrifies Labor, which is precisely why Bill Shorten will be dreading its upcoming national conference, where Labor's factions will tear at each other's throats over whether or not to support Abbott's policy of turning back boats. A significant portion of the party would find this scandalous, but Shorten knows that if he fails to adopt it, the Coalition will hammer its political advantage mercilessly. And that's why he's manoeuvring to capitulate. It's a study of how Labor behaves on issues where public sentiment runs against it.If Labor struggles to press home a popular argument, it has long since abandoned hope of mounting an unpopular one – which is why it spent most of its last term pretending it could deliver a surplus. And right now, any kind of restraint on asylum seeker policy is about as unpopular as it gets. Shorten would need to counter the torrent of anti-boat people hysteria that has gripped the country since Paul Keating. That's unlikely, so we can expect Labor to acquiesce.And it is here that Labor's differences with the Coalition are sharpest. Faced with its own idiosyncrasies, the Coalition chooses neither to acquiesce, nor to persuade, but rather to bludgeon. We're seeing that from some of the Coalition's hardiest warriors on same-sex marriage and renewable energy, for example. And we're certainly seeing that with Q&A. Abbott is playing to a crowd – both within and without his party room – whose incandescent hatred of the ABC long predates Zaky Mallah's infamy.The trouble is that crowd is very small. The ABC remains vastly more popular than any government, and the broader electorate simply has no interest in seeing a Prime Minister treat it like some enemy of the state that is on the wrong "side". Abbott's running against public sympathies here, on an issue with almost no mainstream resonance. He's doing it with all the vigour Labor doesn't, and none of the touch someone like Howard did.These are our times. Labor refuses to prosecute a difficult argument. The Coalition cannot prosecute one without finding an enemy to prosecute along with it. But no one is inviting us into a civil exchange. Perhaps with our instant online outrage and shallowing media cycle we're not the best guests. Sure, I'll accept that. But politicians aren't merely self-interested combatants. They're custodians of our political culture. And on that score there's a problem because it's never been easier to win politically by destroying politics.
**********Three weeks in, it's still an election about nothing in particular********May 26, 2016******253**** When was the last time anyone voted for anyone? Barack Obama in 2008. Maybe Kevin 07? Other than that, examples are thin on the ground. Australians didn't vote for anyone at all in 2010, voted against Labor (and certainly not for Abbott) in 2013, and have now very quickly fallen out of love with Malcolm Turnbull almost as thoroughly as we dropped Rudd. This year Americans will either vote against Donald Trump and put Hillary Clinton in the White House, or they'll vote against politics altogether and put Trump there. An average of national polls this week put Trump slightly ahead. Yes.Meanwhile, Austria came within a whisker of electing a far-right president. It's largely a ceremonial role, but it's hardly a token result. Norbert Hofer is the kind of character who has now become an utterly familiar part of the political landscape: he has obvious counterparts in Slovakia, in Hungary, in Poland, in Switzerland, in Greece, in Sweden, in the Netherlands, even in France and Britain in the forms of Marine Le Pen and Nigel Farage. Now note the ubiquitous description of these figures: anti-immigrant, anti-EU. It's a surging movement defined overwhelmingly by what it's against.But here's the kicker: Hofer didn't even lose to a usual suspect. He lost to a fellow outlier: a former Green running as an independent, who'd be considered radical by the standards of conventional politics. But that's just it. Convention has been obliterated. Austria's two major parties, even with their votes combined, would have come third in this race. They didn't even get to the second-round runoff election. If the politics of the 20th century was a battle between liberalism and socialism, it's becoming something else entirely in the 21st. The problem is that's all it's becoming: something else.Liberalism and socialism were competing, well-formed social visions. They identified grand aims, and proposed means of achieving them. They ground out theories about the role of government and the rights of the citizen. In short, they asked us to buy something positive, even if they were quite negative about each other. And in turns, they earned the approval of voting majorities.Where exactly is that majority now? Liberalism – once a defining characteristic of the right – is now crashing on the shores of right-wing populism. From Trump to Hofer, this movement is economically protectionist in a way that makes serious liberals shudder. And socialism commenced falling apart once the Cold War ended, before comprehensively doing so in the wake of the financial crisis. It depends on a shared sense of solidarity amongst its citizenry, and yet this is precisely what democracies no longer have. That's why socialism's natural supporters have abandoned it: this week a staggering 86 per cent of Austria's manual workers voted for Hofer.The truth is there are no majorities anymore. Not in any positive sense. Since the financial crisis, elites are under populist assault. But the underclass now includes everyone from white nationalist blue-collar workers to well-educated but unemployed young people, immigrants and refugees. And that's before you factor in the splintering of public debate into a million online forums, and as many completely different publics. That's not to say people cannot win elections. Clearly they must. But it is to say that the terms on which those elections can be won have narrowed drastically.Democratic politics has become so debased, so mistrusted, so fractured, that the only genuine form of currency now seems to be opposition. Much has been said about the idea that politics has now become post-ideological; that it has become about nothing much. But the truth is worse than that. We're in an age where the only way to cobble together a majority is to run against something.We're in the age of dissent. And in an age like this, power can only be grasped via some manufactured coalition of anger. That, of course, is utterly unsustainable because no sooner does that coalition succeed than it becomes the very target of the next wave of protest. It rages its way to power only to be raged out of it at the next available opportunity. That's why Abbott existed. It's why even Turnbull is now running a campaign as though he's an opposition leader. And more broadly, it's why we're now able to shed prime ministers with such effortless speed in this country.But perhaps nothing illustrates this quite so perfectly as Austria. Hofer's alarming success was the clear product of a protest vote. But ultimately, so was his failure. The eventual victor, Alexander Van der Bellen, might be the first Green in the world to be elected head of state, but he was an extremely reluctant choice. Hofer soundly beat him in the first round, and the result was only reversed once both major parties unenthusiastically backed Van der Bellen in the runoff as a lesser evil. Indeed, Van der Bellen himself argued that same case, pleading for the votes of people "who don't like me but perhaps like Hofer even less". And after all that, he won by just 31,000 votes.This week our own interminable election campaign has shrunk to something of remarkable smallness. We've seen all manner of ping pong over costings and black holes, and funding announcements about things like localised mobile phone dead spots. We're three weeks into this campaign and the preponderance of jobs-and-growth-style slogans aside, it's still impossible to identify what this election is really about. There are flashpoints – negative gearing, maybe some health funding, possibly even boats – but there's no central, definitive theme. This philosophical vacuum will naturally be filled by negative politicking, which is why Labor's so relentless on Turnbull's elitism and the Coalition wants to whack Shorten as weak on asylum seekers. But what if this isn't a story of uninspired campaigning? What if this is just democracy now? Maybe it's time to stop expecting anything more because in the age of dissent, we'll only punish anyone who offers it.
**********House prices: is the ground beginning to shift at last?********June 11, 2015******420**** Every few years the opposition discovers the problem of housing affordability. For now, it is Labor fuming relentlessly about how "out of touch" Joe Hockey is for suggesting the apparent solution to soaring house prices is a better job. But Hockey was once in opposition himself, and back then he threw similar barbs. "(Treasurer Wayne) Swan must explain why housing is more (affordable) when Melb prices rose 20% last yr", he tweeted in 2010. "The biggest challenge is housing affordability over the next few years", he reiterated a few months later, on the eve of an election. He was right, of course. Even if he now disagrees with himself.That's the cycle. Oppositions thunder about house prices, form government, watch it get worse, then go back to opposition, where they thunder all over again. Rudd did it to Howard. Abbott did it to Rudd and Gillard. Now Shorten is doing it to Abbott. There's a reason it's like this: behind all the heat, anger and politicking, we've had a raging consensus on policy that dramatically privileges the interests of those who own property over those who don't.  It has been this way for at least 15 years, and it's the product of a worldview that means the only solutions you can find are the kind Hockey has offered. Yes, this was a gaffe. But let's be clear: Hockey's was a crime of politics, and if you're the Labor Party, not of policy. The bare fact is that housing is unaffordable because the market is flooded with investors.  Fewer than half of our houses are owned by people living in them. About 30 years ago that figure was around 85 per cent. And if we're honest, that's exactly what both parties have been aiming for, given the way our tax system works.  If you're a high-income earner, you have a choice: you can either pay half your earnings in tax, or, thanks to concessions on things like negative gearing and capital gains tax, you can put it into property and pay about a quarter. The result, put crudely, is rich people buying houses they don't particularly want, but which poorer people want to live in. Naturally, the wealthy can afford to pay a bit more for them, so the price goes up. And since both sides of politics are determined to make sure house prices keep going up, investors take minimal risk and first-home seekers have increasingly minimal hope.But think about what this worldview is telling you. It says work is worth less than investment, which is why it's taxed higher. And that, of course, is an option only open to the fortunate. That is the true significance of Hockey's words. They merely disclose the assumption on which this bipartisan system is based: that all this could be yours, if only you try hard enough.  It's a myth, of course. Indeed, there are several reasons Hockey's claims collapse. First, that if everyone could somehow heed his advice and get a well-salaried job, that would simply swamp the housing market with cash, driving prices up even faster and rendering our shiny new jobs suddenly and hopelessly inadequate. And second, that this is a government that just last year was fretting out "something akin" to a "wages explosion" even as our wages are growing at the slowest rate since the ABS started keeping the data. The last thing it seems to want is for us to get higher-paid jobs.But myths are inevitable when you transform the free market from an economic arrangement into a political philosophy. You wind up assuming opportunity is more or less equal, that individuals control their respective fates, and that empowering the wealthy to increase their wealth will, by some abstract mechanism, enrich us all. Thus, you pretend the market simply redistributes power and wealth according to talent and effort, and doesn't also concentrate these things among those who start with an advantage. In the case of housing, that means older people who were able to enter the market before it raced out of reach.We're apparently determined to be blind to this. Partly that's because property owners represent a seriously powerful bloc of votes, making their interests approximately sacred. But it's also because to see this would cause a consensus worldview to crumble. That's why Hockey's present solution – to increase "supply" by building more houses – is exactly the same as his predecessor's. It's a good idea, but it's far from complete because it can't guarantee investors wouldn't snap up these extra dwellings as well, and the current construction boom (including record numbers of residential building approvals) hasn't yet solved the problem. It dominates, though, because it's politically and ideologically painless. It is the solution that preserves our market-based dogma.It's one thing to preserve a mythology in ordinary times. But what if our times are becoming rapidly less ordinary? We're now witnessing a generation of Australians on the verge of realising they might never own a home. We've never seen that before. And with it we're witnessing the slow death of an idea: that the free-marketeer's great loves – investment and capital – do not automatically improve everyone's lot. That's why criticisms of negative gearing are working their way into mainstream conversation in a way unthinkable only a year ago. It's why the Greens this week launched a policy to wind it back, and Labor, which spent six years in power steadfastly refusing to do the same – choosing instead to roll out a suite of profoundly ineffective policies – has now said it is considering it.  The Coalition, given its own ideological convictions, will naturally be the last to rethink this. But there is something telling that an actual, fundamental difference on housing policy might be emerging as an electoral battleground. Whatever the short-term result, that's a serious shift. It can be hard to see that shift beyond the gaffes and the breathless, populist ranting that seem so familiar and occupy us so pointlessly. But it's worth looking if you can, because our politics might be being remade before our eyes.
