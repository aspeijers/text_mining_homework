**********Abbott's 18C puzzle: linking terror and free speech raises interesting political questions********August 8, 2014******284**** It’s beginning to feel a lot like Christmas. Not in the joy and tinsel and presents kind of way. More in the manufactured-panic-about-a-war-on-Christmas kind of way. Are you familiar with this annual ritual? Some kindergarten or other decides not to hold a nativity play, or to replace its Christmas party with some generic “end-of-year” fare and then it’s on: political correctness has gone mad, and non-Christian minorities – namely Muslims – are holding good, decent, Christmas-loving Australians to ransom. Our culture is being sacrificed as an offering to a minority that doesn’t know its place.All this came rushing back to me this week as the Abbott government announced it was dropping its proposed amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act. The announcement wasn’t altogether surprising, but the context for it was. Suddenly section 18C would be left alone as a figleaf for Muslims; a kind of transfer fee for their recruitment to “Team Australia”. Consider how that looks if you believe – as presumably the government still does – this section is an egregious attack on free speech. Apparently we must continue to live under its yoke to appease Muslims in the hope that they’ll help us fight terrorism. We’re being held to ransom again. Muslims are the Grinch who stole freedom.The truth, of course, is that Muslims are largely peripheral to both issues. I don’t think I’ve met a single Muslim – or indeed a member of any other religious minority – who could care less about public Christmassy-ness. And whilst I have met Muslims who were unimpressed by the government’s plans for the Racial Discrimination Act, it seems an unusual red line for them to draw given that Muslims aren’t even protected by it. The law doesn’t regard Muslims as a racial group. So, whatever it is section 18C prevents you from saying about Aborigines or Asians or Jews, you can go right ahead and say it about Muslims. That’s exactly why Victoria introduced laws specifically targeting religious vilification: because the Racial Discrimination Act has nothing to say about it.So, it’s already started on talkback radio. But with any luck it won’t stick because the Abbott government’s political calculations here are so transparent. The fight against 18C was widely unpopular and politically costly. Thus did the government become horribly entangled, desperately needing a way to extricate itself. For a time it sought to do this by politely ignoring the issue, burying it beneath a process of reviewing public submissions and considering revisions.  But this wasn’t really a solution. Public impressions had been well set, and the government was now associated with the proposal, whether or not it was actively pursuing it. It needed somehow to dissociate itself without being seen simply to have dumped its policy. So now it is dumped as a counter-terrorism strategy. It’s an audacious move that relies on the idea that once any proposal is presented as a security measure, it is considerably more difficult to oppose. In truth, it’s a bit too audacious, even if it looked neat enough on paper.The real trouble is that it takes the Abbott government to all sorts of places I very much doubt it wants to go. If 18C has been preserved in the interests of “national unity”, is the government admitting that its promise to amend it was divisive?  If so, what does it think of the kind of rhetoric that violates 18C? Does that compromise national unity, too?  Surely it is worse to engage in racial discrimination yourself than merely to propose legalising it out of a commitment to liberal freedoms. Surely it is more divisive to be a bigot than to stand for someone’s right to bigoted expression. Does that mean that those who breach the Racial Discrimination Act are undermining Team Australia?To draw a specific connection between 18C and counter-terrorism requires a long bow. But the mere attempt to do so has intriguing philosophical consequences. By presenting divisive politics as a security concern, the government is implicitly accepting the social dimensions of terrorism. It suggests that terrorism gathers around feelings of alienation and social exclusion; that intelligence flows best from communities that feel valued and included rather than surveilled, suspected and interrogated. This, as it happens, accords with the best research we have on the psychology of radicalisation and effective counter-terrorism policing. It accords far less well, however, with the way that governments tend to talk about terrorism. Is the Abbott government a devotee of this approach?  If so, does it intend to reinstate the Countering Violent Extremism program – and in particular its grants for community programs aimed at “Building Community Resilience” – that it let lapse in June? Is it reconsidering the regime of preventative detention and control orders? You know, the ones that were so abused in the Mohammed Haneef case, and which clearly spook many Muslims who fear their arbitrary use?  The ones that the government’s own legislative monitor recommended be abolished because they are “not effective, not appropriate and not necessary”? Or do the social dimensions of terrorism somehow begin and end with the Racial Discrimination Act? Certainly seems an odd place to end. But then, unless you focus on the political manoeuvring, it’s an odder place to start.
**********MH17, Gaza and the value of human life********July 25, 2014******605**** I’ve been thinking a lot lately about the value of human life. About the lives so cheaply lost on MH17. About the anger and grief this tragedy has unleashed. About the sense of sacredness and solemn ceremony that followed it. There’s something cathartic about all this. That we mark this with ritual public grieving tells us that these lives – and therefore our own lives – are sanctified; that their termination is an almost blasphemous violation. On some level this reassures us, which is probably why we pore over news coverage of such events, seizing on small harrowing details and the personal stories of the victims.But I’ve also been thinking a lot about why it is these lives particularly that have earned such a response. The more I heard journalists and politicians talk about how 37 Australians were no longer with us, the stranger it began to sound. Something of that magnitude happens just about every week on our roads, for instance. In the last week for which we have official data, 29 people were killed this way. The youngest was two. We held no ceremonies, and we had no public mourning of the fact that they, too, were no longer with us.Why? I don’t ask critically, because I’m as unmoved by the road toll as anyone. But it’s surely worth understanding how it is we decide which deaths matter, and which don't; which ones are galling and tragic, and which ones are mere statistics. We tell ourselves we care about the loss of innocent life as though it’s a cardinal, unwavering principle, but the truth is we rationalise the overwhelming majority of it. What does that tell us about ourselves?Here, the most obvious counterpoint is the nightmare unfolding in Gaza. As I write this, nearly 600 people – overwhelmingly civilians a third of whom are children – have been killed. By the time this goes to print, that number will be redundant. There’s grief, there’s anger and there’s some international hand-wringing, but nothing that compares with the urgency and rage surrounding MH17, even if there is twice the human cost.If you take your cues from social media, on which this comparison is being relentlessly drawn, the reason is simple: Palestinians are not rich Westerners, and so their lives simply don’t matter. No doubt there’s some truth to this: humans are tribal animals, and we’re as tribal in death as we are in life. But it’s not an entirely satisfactory explanation because it comes from people who would likely exempt themselves from this rule. And yet those same people have almost certainly grieved comparatively little over the thousands of South Sudanese killed in the past six months, or the 1.5 million to have been displaced. Should we conclude they value African lives less than Palestinian ones? It’s not merely a matter of cultural affinity. Consider the Egyptian press, which has wholeheartedly embraced the Israeli offensive. “Sorry Gazans, I cannot support you until you rid yourselves of Hamas,” wrote Adel Nehaman in Al-Watan. He was comprehensively outdone by Al-Ahram’s Azza Sami who tweeted “Thank you Netanyahu, and God give us more men like you to destroy Hamas”. Then she prayed for the deaths of all “Hamas members, and everyone who loves Hamas”. Meanwhile, television presenter Tawfik Okasha urged Egyptians to “forget Gaza”, adding for colour that “Gazans are not men” because they don’t “revolt against Hamas”. That, presumably includes the hospital patients or the kids playing football on the beach who have been bombed in the past week or so.This is about as thorough a dehumanisation of Gazans as you’ll find anywhere in the world. Israel’s media doesn’t even come close. And this in a country where the Palestinian cause has been a kind of social glue for decades. But that’s what happens when the sanctity of life meets the power of politics. For the Egyptian media – now effectively a propaganda arm of the government – Gaza merely represents a chance to attack the Muslim Brotherhood, from which Hamas emerged. It doesn’t matter who dies. It doesn’t matter how many. What matters is that their lives – and especially their deaths – can be used in the service of the story they are so desperate to tell.And that, I fear, is a universal principle. It is not merely the death of innocents that moves us, even in very large numbers. It is the circumstances of it that matter. We decide which deaths to mourn, which to ignore, which to celebrate, and which to rationalise on the basis of what story we want them to tell. Palestinian deaths matter more than Sudanese ones if you want to tell a story of Israeli aggression. Israeli deaths matter more than Palestinian ones if you want to tell a story of Hamas terrorism. Asylum seeker deaths at sea matter more than those on land if you want tell a story about people smuggling. But a death in detention trumps all if your story is about government brutality. And a death from starvation matters if you want to tell a story about global inequality – which so few people do. Everyone will insist they’re merely giving innocent human lives their due. And that’s true but only in the most partial sense. These are political stories driven by political commitments.MH17 allowed us to mourn and to rage because it delivered a story we were well prepared to tell. It’s easy to rage when the plot is one of Russian complicity, roguishness and cover-up. And frankly, Russia deserves the whack it’s getting for its handling of the aftermath. But in my most naive moments I hope for a world where the value of human life is universal enough that we can outrage ourselves; where we can tell the stories we don’t particularly want to; the stories in which we are neither the heroes nor the victims, but the guilty. That’s what we’re asking of Russia. One day someone mourning no less than we are will ask it of us.
**********Tony Abbott's harsh treatment of asylum seekers is the same old story********July 11, 2014******438**** Occasionally you have to pause to take stock of just how bizarre Australia’s asylum seeker debate has become. In summary, it works like this: the Coalition implements a policy that is mostly Labor’s while pretending it is doing something so uniquely tough that no one else could possibly be so courageous. Labor, meanwhile, objects because that’s what oppositions do, while trying delicately to avoid criticising the very thing it has unleashed. The mainstream public responds, in poll after poll, with a mix of approval and bloodlust. Some call for even harsher measures though it is difficult to imagine what that would mean. Operation Sovereign Slaughter, perhaps?  Events might punctuate this story, but they do not truly alter it. There’s a death or suicide in detention here, and a High Court intervention there. These matter, but they don’t Matter. Nothing evolves, nothing is reset. Whatever talk there might be that the Abbott government this week encountered its “children overboard” moment overlooks the fact that that episode did nothing to damage Howard’s fortunes, and that whatever demonisation of asylum seekers it might have embodied, the tradition is clearly flourishing. That’s why reports of detainees’ attempted suicides are seen not as tragic signs of unbearable mental pain, but as a cynical political strategem; dismissed as merely rank “blackmail”.  So for all the incredulity, all the outrage, all the lawyering that this week has produced, it’s worth realising that we hardly crossed an intolerable threshold. At least not if that means we did something far beyond what we’ve done before. Perhaps the most confronting fact in all this is that whatever it is we did to those Sri Lankan boat people, there was very little that was new about it.  Let’s begin with the thought that by sending asylum seekers into the arms of the Sri Lankan navy we’re returning them to their torturers. It’s true that Sri Lanka’s human rights record is poor on this point. Indeed, it was bad enough for Canada and India to boycott the Commonwealth summit Sri Lanka hosted last November. It’s also true that, particularly in the case of Tamils, there are substantial grounds for believing they are in danger of being tortured. And it’s therefore an abundantly plain violation of the single most basic tenet of the Refugee Convention.  But it’s also true that we’ve done this before. Lots. We’ve sent people back to the Taliban to be killed for years. And in the case of Sri Lanka, we’ve returned more than 1000 people. Only it was the previous Labor government that did it. Indeed Chris Bowen, then Immigration Minister, was proud of the fact. He’d call these returns “steps forward” because those are the terms of our public conversation. It’s not a success when we resettle someone fleeing persecution. It’s a success when we manage not to.  The difference in Labor’s case was that the returns Bowen was celebrating were voluntary. Faced with the prospect of detention in Nauru or Papua New Guinea, these people decided to go home. Scott Morrison’s latest episode has seen them forcibly handed over to Sri Lanka. And at first blush, this seems a significant difference. But it’s far less significant than it appears.  That’s because in both cases, there was no assessment process worthy of the name. We now know the present government is doing it by teleconference, asking four preliminary questions before rejecting them. It is this practice, as much as anything, that has the government sweating it out in the High Court right now. But again, it’s hardly new. These days it carries the mocking name of “enhanced screening”, but it used to be called “screening out” and some version of it has been around for decades.  It’s about the most cynical way there is of getting around the law. You don’t even wait for an asylum application, you just press ahead with a cursory informal interview. If they don’t say all of the right things about why they’re there, you simply tell them they aren’t eligible and encourage them to give up. The trouble is that they typically have no idea why they’re being interviewed, so often don’t understand they are being asked to make their case.  And it’s what they don’t understand that makes this work a treat. You don’t tell them this isn’t a formal assessment. You certainly don’t tell them that they have a right to go ahead and apply anyway. And for God’s sake you don’t tell them they have a right to a lawyer. You just daze them with bureaucratic smoke and hope they’ll be confused and disappointed enough to go away. Usually they do, probably because they’re under the false impression their application has been rejected. Suddenly, Labor’s returns don’t look nearly so voluntary.  This, you’d think, is crying out for a High Court challenge. And here we are. But even on that score, we’ve been here before. The challenge never concludes because the government simply settles out of court. That’s exactly what happened last year, and it may well happen again this time if the government decides simply to take this latest boatload of asylum seekers somewhere else, making the High Court case moot.  It’s entirely possible these people are economic migrant and not refugees, as both major parties variously claim. Indeed it’s more likely in the case of Sinhalese boat people than, say, the boats that come from Indonesia. But the point is we don’t know because we determinedly don’t assess them. It’s a total subversion of the refugee system, but it’s a bipartisan subversion, which is why Labor’s only real attack is that the Abbott government should be more transparent. Fair enough. But what if it were? What could it say that wouldn’t sound remarkably familiar?
**********Jailing of Peter Greste in Egypt reveals principles are the first casualty in the war on terror********June 27, 2014******109**** Let’s begin by stating the embarrassingly obvious: Peter Greste’s seven-year prison term in Egypt is an outrage. This wasn’t Kafka. It was worse than that. Not only was Greste clueless about his supposed crime – his prosecutors were. At one point they played the film clip of Gotye’s Somebody That I Used to Know in the courtroom with no explanation whatsoever. That’s the kind of thing you can call evidence when the result is predetermined. In those circumstances you might as well entertain yourselves. And it really is a cracker of a film clip.But now let’s state the less obvious: this wasn’t the political fix it might first appear. Today’s Egypt has much in common with Hosni Mubarak’s one, but it is not exactly the same. The current President, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, does not control the judiciary in the same direct way as Mubarak did.This judiciary is independent in a fashion. It’s just that lots of its members are more interested in politics than in evidence. And on this issue, the court’s politics happen to match those of al-Sisi. Both have a deep, visceral, insatiable hatred for the Muslim Brotherhood. That’s why neither blinked as they invoked death sentences for Brotherhood members literally by the hundred – also without anything approximating a close examination of the evidence. Peter Greste is neither the first, nor the most unfortunate victim of this system.The point is that this is not the iron will of a dictator. This attitude is now socialised. That’s why these events are, by and large, acceptable to the Egyptian people whose media has been in full-blown propaganda mode since Mohamed Mursi was thrown out of office. That propaganda holds that the Brotherhood is a terrorist organisation posing some kind of existential threat to Egypt, that al-Sisi is barely short of sainthood, and anyone who protests his power or is otherwise critical of his government either supports or sympathises with terrorists. It works partly because the Brotherhood proved so toxic and divisive in power, partly because terrorism has become a real problem particularly in the Sinai, and partly because this narrative is so relentlessly repeated with no effective counterpoint.Greste’s problem is simply that he works for al-Jazeera – which the Egyptian regime deems to be a mouthpiece for the Brotherhood. He has every reason to protest that he was merely reporting the news, but that necessarily means exposing some of the regime’s excesses and in Egypt that’s enough to make you a lying, terrorist supporter. And that’s exactly what the charges were: supporting the Brotherhood and spreading false news.All of which should lead us to stop and realise just how astonishing it is that we find ourselves here. Who would have thought, when Egypt was in the throes of its revolutionary fervour, when its people had apparently vanquished a dictator with an irresistible cry for democracy, that its people would so soon approve of this farcical, authoritarian injustice? And who would have guessed – say, 10 years ago – that the Western world would be livid enough to demand the political overturning of the judiciary for the sake of some al-Jazeera journalists?Al-Jazeera! Once upon a time not so very long ago, it was Western politicians – like Donald Rumsfeld – describing them as the “mouthpiece of al-Qaeda”. And it was their propagandists – like Bill O’Reilly –  brandin it a terrorist organisation that shouldn't be allowed in America. Last year he even warned its anchors that "they behead you" if you "misbehave". “Sure,” you retort, “but these are just words – not the imprisonment of journalists after a sham trial”.  And that’s true. But it probably doesn’t mean much to Sami al-Hajj, the al-Jazeera cameraman who was locked up in Guantanamo Bay for six years without any trial at all – even a sham one – before the Bush administration decided there was nothing to charge him with. Greste was held in solitary confinement. If you believe al-Hajj’s lawyer, he was physically and sexually abused.In those days al-Jazeera’s main crime was that it broadcast statements from Osama bin Laden to which they had gained exclusive access – which is to say that it broadcast what any news organisation would regard as news. That was al-Jazeera’s argument then, in exactly the way it is its argument now. In both cases it’s an argument with force, but nowhere near the force of Rumsfeldian labels like "terrorist sympathiser" or as the Egyptian media has taken to calling Greste and his colleagues (among others), the “Marriott terror cell”.This is what the threat of terrorism does to us. It suspends our rationality. Terrorism is perhaps the most emotive form of politics humans have, which is why it is defined not by the causes it serves, but by the emotion – terror – it evokes. Once we are convinced of the threat there is almost no principle that can survive it, no matter how civilised we think we are. Due process, open justice, privacy, the presumption of innocence; it’s all up for grabs if we’re pushed far enough. We’ll shred the Magna Carta if we feel we have to. Just look at what we did to habeas corpus. Or better yet, ask Mohamed Haneef.That’s where Egypt is right now: in a place without any real principles; a place of pure politics, where the only thing that matters is power and the complete destruction of the enemy – in this case the Muslim Brotherhood. There will be guilt by association and there will be collateral damage, and it will be serenely ignored by anyone who shares that goal.  We can be outraged by this – even if we didn’t much care until an Australian got caught up in it. We can even deride Egypt, as Peter Reith recently did, as “a very nasty totalitarian police state” with “a pretend judiciary” – even if that has been true for 30 years during which time we were happy to call Egypt our friend. But if we look hard enough, we’ll recognise there is something all too human about this monstrous injustice. We’ll see this is what happens to a nation that has terrified itself. If even durable, mature, successful democracies like us or the United States can trade in our principles for hysteria on occasion, what hope did a dysfunctional nation with no real political culture like Egypt have?Waleed Aly is an Age columnist.

**********Western invasion paved way for Iraq's terror crisis********June 13, 2014******259**** Over 11 years ago we entered a war of choice on a pretext that was always dubious and proved ultimately false. There are several reasons we did this: a messianic belief in the democratisation of the Middle East; a desire to project Western power and install a compliant ruler in Saddam Hussein’s place; in Australia’s case, pursuing the US alliance. But beneath them all lies one essential conceit: we did this because we thought we could. Perhaps some of our soldiers, and multiples more Iraqi civilians would die, but we figured that would be the limit of the fallout. At the very least we assumed our power would be enhanced. At our most delirious we might have believed we’d leave the world a better place.Indeed that idea hasn’t gone away. When relentless mass uprisings in the Middle East began toppling dictators and promising democracy, the Iraq War’s apologists rushed to claim credit for the change. Saddam’s defeat had unleashed a wave of democratic fervour and a belief in the transience of rulers, so they reasoned. But today, as democracy in Egypt descends into farce and the uprisings in Syria have exploded into the most horrific civil war, this is perhaps not a legacy we should wish to claim. And now, there’s Iraq itself. Specifically Mosul, which this week fell to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Barely a decade after we set out to save the world, terrorists rule one of Iraq’s major cities. “We can’t beat them. We can’t,” says an Iraqi police officer. “They are well trained in street fighting and we’re not. We need a whole army to drive them out of Mosul.” Which might at least sound possible if it weren’t for the army colonel who explained that we’ve just witnessed “a total collapse of the security forces”. This is quite a spectacular step backwards.The invasion of Iraq happened in strange times, about 18 months after the Twin Towers fell and when security was about hard military power and little else. Shock. Awe. President Bush’s original name for the war in Afghanistan gives us a good sense of the mood: Operation Infinite Justice. Justice is about balance and measure, not the excesses of infinity. Infinite Justice is the kind of thing you come up with when you think it is impossible to be too forceful; when you think justice subsists in bombing places to rubble.As a result, we never truly bothered with trifling matters like sociology. Iraq was a theatre of domination and triumph – of missions accomplished. We scarcely noticed it was in fact a complicated society with significance to people well beyond its borders. By the time we discovered Sunnis and Shiites it was all a bit late. We had on our hands a full-scale, international insurgency.And the truth is, we never really defeated it. Indeed the invasion has unleashed forces we simply cannot pretend to have under control. Mosul, after all, isn’t Fallujah or Baghdad with a reputation for fearsome violence. This is a city once held up as a model of Iraqi success: “a model for what Iraq would be like if they could emulate in Baghdad the progress we have made here”, in the words of one commanding officer in 2007 after the famous troop “surge” that was meant to have pacified the city.But even so, it’s impossible to understand this turnaround in Mosul without looking just over the border, in Syria, where a ruler every bit as brutal as Saddam Hussein, is presently in the process of enacting mass violence against his own people. This is a ruler who has merrily danced across what Barack Obama declared to be his “red line” by using chemical weapons against them, proving that this red line didn’t signify much. Obama ran an anaemic campaign for military intervention in Syria that went nowhere. These days he regards Syria merely as “somebody else’s civil war”.We will never know what would have happened had America intervened at that stage. But we do know that Bashar al-Assad had free reign to unleash brutal force, thereby radicalising the environment and laying down a magnet for Sunni terrorist groups. And we now know that those groups are enmeshed with those in Iraq. ISIS doesn’t see the border between the countries. It sees instead an area to be unified under its own rule. Mosul is in terrorist hands because we blew the lid off Iraq, then refused to help put it back on Syria. They are quickly becoming indistinct: the same crisis.The contrast is remarkable: there’s the war with no meaningful pretext, and the pretext that had no war. Sure, this is explained partly by the fact that we’re dealing with two contrasting American presidents. But it’s also true that the disaster of Iraq exposed the limits of America’s power, and completely eroded its moral authority, leaving it with no standing, and no will to do anything about a genuine problem in Syria. We haven’t yet come to terms with just how much damage the invasion of Iraq has done. It’s likely we won’t fully know for decades. But it’s clear that the blowback is already under way, and there’s every chance we’ll wake one day to find that Iraq evolves into the security problem it so emphatically wasn’t in 2003 when we grotesquely pretended otherwise.
**********Hockey's change of mind not proof of hypocrisy********May 30, 2014******292**** There’s just so much to love about the Nine News report on the student protests against higher education fees from 1987 that suddenly re-emerged this week. Peter Harvey, for example, with his celebrated, impossibly low, authoritative tones coming (as they almost always did) from Canberra. His awful brown suit, matched only by the dated fashion of the student protesters he was covering. But the star turn comes undoubtedly from a young Joe Hockey, pledging to “go out onto the streets and to protest … in our campaign for free education”.Touche. As archival footage goes, it’s a good get. But here’s the question: beyond the obvious entertainment value, why should we care about this?The implicit charge – frequently made explicit by an array of internet warriors – is one of hypocrisy. There’s socialist Joe the student unionist who thought deregulating tertiary fees was “suicidal for student welfare”, and there’s cigar-smoking Joe the Liberal heavyweight who now presides over such homicidal policy because it doesn’t affect him.  We’re being asked to conclude that one of them is disingenuous or has sold out to the other. What we’re not being asked to conclude is that someone’s position might change over the course of 27 years. Or that the world might have changed sufficiently in that time to make someone feel a change in position is justified. In short, we’re being asked to hold Hockey to an inhuman standard that demands he adopt one position on all things throughout his life irrespective of circumstance.On that score Labor’s Shadow Assistant Treasurer Andrew Leigh might empathise. He has spent a good chunk of this week sitting in Parliament watching the Abbott government throw his own prose back in his face.  Leigh, it appears, was once a fan of deregulating university fees in precisely the way Joe Hockey wasn’t. This he committed to print in book form in 2004, a year after he had written an op-ed spruiking co-payments for GP visits much as the Coalition has now proposed. The government seems to think this is some sort of miraculous, decisive gift.But, again: why should we care? Like Joe Hockey, Andrew Leigh was a student at the time. Is it possible that a decade of exposure to new ideas, experiences and information might have led him to change his view? It’s a substance-free, opportunistic way of arguing that the Abbott government has chosen here, and now that the Hockey-as-free-education-warrior vision has emerged, we can expect the Labor opposition to return the favour. If they do, it will be equally opportunistic and substance-free.Neither Leigh’s nor Hockey’s volte-faces are scandalous. In fact they both sit comfortably with the broader worldviews they have most recently expressed. Leigh writes incisively about inequality and the stubbornness of privilege in exactly the manner you might expect of someone who has since abandoned ideas like university fee deregulation. Hockey famously spoke about ending the “age of entitlement” even as his party was defending middle-class welfare. You might not like their respective positions, but there is little to indicate they are insincerely held.The idea that they should be embarrassed to have once thought differently, or that this exposes them as partisan hypocrites, merely exposes our political culture as one of confected warfare, where changes of heart are automatic evidence of dishonesty rather than of reflection. We should instead be demanding that our representatives change their views over time. We should expect them to be open to persuasion. And it follows they should have the freedom to be persuaded without attracting some kind of summary judgment for it. That doesn’t mean there isn’t crass hypocrisy and opportunism in politics. Of course there is. It’s possible we saw an example of it this week when Martin Hamilton-Smith, a Liberal stalwart and former party leader, stunningly joined the South Australian Labor government with no prior warning and scant explanation. It’s possible we saw it in the previous federal Labor government on asylum seekers when it first insisted boat arrivals had nothing to do with domestic policy, then shifted dramatically to a policy not merely of offshore processing, but offshore resettlement.  And it’s also possible we’ve seen it for years in Tony Abbott’s position on climate change policy, where, as Malcolm Turnbull has so famously put it, he “in the space of a few months held every possible position on the issue, each one contradicting the position he expressed earlier”.Yes, we should be awake to backflips of convenience. Certainly, we should be holding politicians to account for them, particularly where the political calculations are so short-term and transparent. But not all changes of mind are equal. Not all are poll-inspired and politically cynical. What we need is the capacity to distinguish between the two. A public culture that rushes to judgments of hypocrisy, that fails this test of discernment, is an impoverished one destined for an endless cycle of adolescent sparring that masquerades as a policy debate. It’s a kind of gotcha politics that is more entertaining than edifying. Politicians should be allowed to be people whose positions swing and evolve. If we have inhuman demands of them, we might just find that inhuman brutes, impervious to thought and reflection, are the only ones capable of meeting our requirements.
**********No way Abbott can now budget for a second term********May 22, 2014******659**** Tony Abbott was clearly deflecting this week when he declared his job “is not to win a popularity contest”. It’s the kind of thing no democratic politician really believes, but which you must say in the face of catastrophic polling of the order presently dogging his government. For now the popular focus is on whether or not Abbott can recover; whether this will be the fortnight that ultimately relegates him to a single term. But in truth there are bigger questions here, and the Coalition faces a conundrum far tougher than merely figuring out how to win the next election. And it’s a conundrum created well before last Tuesday.The reason the government broke so many promises in this budget is simple: the promises they made from Opposition were wildly contradictory. You cannot rein in deficits and abolish two major taxes, and replace one of them with a climate change policy that costs billions and promise no tax hikes and quarantine education, health, defence, public broadcasting and pensions from cuts. That’s like a weight-loss diet that does away with protein but promises no cuts to cake and lard! A platform like that was always going to have its day of reckoning. The tragedy is that Abbott didn’t need to do it. He is the Prime Minister today because Labor had descended into an unelectable mess. Even Labor’s popular initiatives such as their Gonski education reforms and the National Disability Insurance Scheme never truly threatened his dominance. Abbott had the freedom not to promise a set of contradictions. He had the freedom to keep his options open and perhaps even to tell us some budgetary truth. But he didn’t. He told us budgetary fantasy as though he hadn’t given a moment’s thought to what would happen after the election.The result is that he brought the Coalition to government with a mandate for almost nothing. Repealing the carbon and mining taxes, sure. Stopping the boats by whatever militant means he could conceive, yes. Paid parental leave, arguably. But what else? Nothing on education, nothing on middle class welfare and especially nothing on industrial relations. In short, nothing that might help repair a budget in “crisis”, real or imagined.But with this budget, the government was behaving as though it had the most monstrous of mandates. It was positively radical in its ambition to break the social democratic model of our welfare state. Encouraging poor people not to go to the doctor by making them pay more for it or leaving young unemployed people without any support for up to six months at a time are things you can only credibly do once you’ve sold a vision to the public. Otherwise they look like randomised cruelty. The reason the government’s reckoning has been so brutal is not merely that the public clearly thinks the budget zeroes in mercilessly on the most vulnerable. It is that it seemed to come from nowhere, without the government even bothering to convince us of the virtues of this approach first.The political calculation here is obvious. This was the tough, axe-wielding budget you get out of the way early in your first term, banking you will have plenty of time to win people back. But it’s not that simple anymore; not when the rejection is this emphatic. So fierce is the reaction that this budget can now only be an ambit claim. Any move Abbott makes from here must be some form of retreat.So it’s not that the Coalition cannot be re-elected in 2016. It’s that now it can only be re-elected via a parade of sweeteners. Precisely what these could be is unclear. For John Howard it took the form of family benefits and tax cuts. Abbott has already trashed the former, and might find the latter difficult in the short term if he really cares at all about the budget. Whatever Abbott finds, it will go against the course he has charted so far. He can either persevere with his austerity reforms, or he can have hope for a second term. But it’s hard to see how he can do both.Which means that Abbott might already have brought his government’s reform phase to an end. What industrial relations policy, for instance, could he possibly risk taking to the next election? How well placed is he to hold a mature debate on raising GST revenue? Indeed what Coalition-friendly reform ideas could he possibly find that will not merely reinforce the mould that has now firmly been cast in the public mind that his politics clearly favours the rich? Abbott simply has no political capital to spend on these things. And if he was unprepared to take anything approaching a contentious reform into an election he was certain to win, it is difficult to see him doing it when he is under electoral threat. That’s a shame because there is no doubt we face serious budgetary and economic questions in the medium term. It’s a shame, too, because it gifts Labor a populist narrative in Opposition that won’t go anywhere near answering those questions. Labor need only rail against Medicare co-payments and petrol prices, now. And it knows it will be railing against a Coalition that has snookered itself. Abbott’s conduct in Opposition meant he came into government with little mandate. His conduct in government ensures next time around, he won’t be able to seek one.
**********Tony Abbott swaps gender politics for rich friends tax********May 1, 2014******220**** Tony Abbott is about to vanish in a puff of existential meaninglessness. Sorry if that sounds heavy, but it seems an inevitable consequence on budget night if he goes ahead with this debt levy proposal. “No new taxes” he boomed in the throes of his anti-Carbon Tax blitz before adding ecstatically: “this is my whole reason for being in politics”.Surprise! Not just for voters, or journalists, but for senior members of Abbott’s very own no-surprises government. “There was no communication from the leader’s office,” revealed one anonymous Liberal. “It’s the biggest f... up we’ve had in a long time.” All of which begs one gigantic question: why? Why would Abbott go anywhere near something so politically dicey, without even consulting his colleagues properly?Perhaps it might be worth violating a Prime Minister’s self-declared raison d’etre and breaking an utterly foundational election promise if it were they only way to stave off Armageddon. But even as emergency fundraising this doesn’t make sense. On any reading, the levy would cover only a tiny fraction of the country's debt. And that's before you factor in how it might encourage people with money to spend less, thereby taking profits away from businesses, and taxes away from the same government apparently so desperate to get more revenue.The only feasible explanation can be that Abbott was searching frantically for a policy that hit middle-to-high-income earners. It's one thing to prepare us for budget pain and tell us it's necessary, but it's quite another to convince people that it's fair. To do that, you need to show - and not merely assert - that everyone will bear some of the brunt. And before this week Abbott had very little to offer anyone looking for examples of rich people making sacrifices. Nothing on, say superannuation or private health insurance. And especially nothing on Paid Parental Leave.Which, as it happens, has much in common with this debt levy idea. It, too, was one of Abbott's "captain's calls". It, too, has incensed Abbott's own teammates. It, too, was designed to give Abbott a story to tell. This week shows us how in both cases, the story got away from him.In the case of Paid Parental Leave, it was about women and Abbott's perceived problem with them. This, you might recall, was a time when Abbott was pitted against Julia Gillard, and voters – especially female ones – still liked her. Abbott wanted a statement, and he went big. So big it drew hearty congratulations from then Greens leader Bob Brown.But Abbott's punch never quite landed. Partly this is because he didn't fully commit to the policy's feminist potential. Perhaps sensing business backlash, he quickly presented it as a productivity measure. Aside from being dubious, that is a macroeconomic claim that has little to do with gender equality. The genuinely feminist argument would have emphasised the cultural change inherent in tying parenting payments to employment: namely that it makes parenting part of workplace culture, and not something to be shoved off to Centrelink where it can be stigmatised as welfare. That, you'd imagine, is the kind of argument Bob Brown might have made. But it has a ring of cultural engineering to it that Abbott was never going to embrace. Even when Abbott talks about parental leave as a workplace entitlement, he doesn't explain why this is potentially so transformational. He often calls his policy “visionary”, but it’s not clear that the gender-equity vision is truly his.And that suggests that perhaps the biggest reason it hasn’t worked for Abbott is simply that it is his policy. Can anyone seriously deny that had Gillard introduced this same scheme - even using the same economically-driven arguments as Abbott - that it would have been viewed through the prism of women’s rights? Or that the Coalition would immediately have derided it as radical, leftist, anti-business nonsense more befitting the Greens (who, of course, would have supported it)?So, instead it has become a policy about class. Suddenly it’s part of a right wing agenda to entrench inequality, rather than a progressive one to drive us towards gender equality. It's not women who benefit, now - it's rich people. Statistically, that's overwhelmingly not the case because women are still significantly underpaid in our society and very few of them earn the kind of money that would max out these payments. But this debate isn't being driven by statistics. There are no statistics thatdemonstrate the asserted productivity benefits of the scheme, either. Rather, this debate is being driven by precisely the thing that motivated Abbott to launch the policy from the start: the politics of impressions. And Tony Abbott, friend of the rich clearly remains a more powerful, compelling impression than Tony Abbott, gender warrior. Evidently, Abbott dearly wants to change this. That’s why he finally agreed this week to scale back his scheme.
**********Barry O'Farrell's Liberal machine as rotten as Labor's********April 17, 2014******297**** Perhaps the most telling aspect of the now infamous thank-you note that ended Barry O’Farrell’s premiership this week is that it was sent so soon after his bone-crushing election victory. This was a man who swept to power thanks largely to the insufferable stench of corruption that had engulfed NSW Labor. Thus was Labor’s position apparently unrecoverable, and O’Farrell apparently invincible. All he had to do was stay clean.And yet, there he was, personally accepting an expensive gift from compromised people, marking his gratitude in ink. I’m prepared to believe he genuinely has no recollection of this. But that only underscores the fact that he saw nothing remarkable about the exchange at all; that even as he must have been hawk-eyed about anything that even remotely connected to the corruption that destroyed Labor, he saw this kind of give and take as standard practice.And on this score, he’s probably right. It’s highly unlikely O’Farrell has a uniquely malfunctioning radar, or that he is more corruptible than his colleagues. Au contraire, the truly remarkable fact is that the Liberals to have been so entangled in this Obeidian octopus have been those widely acknowledged as the best, the straightest, the most upright of them: O’Farrell and Arthur Sinodinos.That tells us plenty. Not so much about the character of these men, but about the nature of the world they routinely inhabit. Until now, the story of NSW corruption has been presented as a thoroughly Labor one, backed at the federal level by the spectre of union corruption so vast it now demands its own royal commission. At every opportunity, the Liberal Party has sought to make this connection. Hence its bizarre pursuit of the complete non-scandal surrounding the Australian Workers Union and Julia Gillard’s time as a labour lawyer, or its constant references to the faceless men of Sussex Street upon Kevin Rudd’s knifing. The point was clear: that the rot was Labor’s rot.But the real world doesn’t respect such nearly confected boundaries. So we shouldn’t be surprised that this scandal has so easily escaped its partisan confines. No Liberal has been found corrupt, but this episode reminds us that the Labor and Liberal parties do not represent two different worlds. There are shades of difference but they are both ultimately similar machines directed at similar goals and subject to the same power plays and moral compromises. At bottom, they represent the same subculture that is the profession of modern politics.That is why, away from the public show of political conflict, politicians tend to get along surprisingly well with each other, in much the same way as members of most other professions do. The professionalisation of politics does not merely mean our political class is drawn from a narrow set of backgrounds. It also means they have markedly similar experiences and move in very similar circles once they’re there. If they aren’t in parliament, they sit on similar boards and offer similar consultancy services to the same group of people. Eddie Obeid might have been Labor’s heart of darkness, but he was only ever a step or two away from the nearest senior Liberal.There’s a self-reinforcing system at play here, of favours and networking and dealing utterly divorced from the democratic process. Worse, it seems beyond reform even when everyone acknowledges both problem and solution. Take the Labor Party, booted so unceremoniously from federal office last year in part because it looked so focused in its own internal manoeuvring.Most recently it copped a flogging in the Western Australian Senate election. Each time this happens, sage elders talk sombrely about wake-up calls and a message from the electorate received. Each time they pledge to create a more grassroots party, less beholden to the kind of political backscratching now on display. And each time nothing happens. That’s the nature of such entrenched systems. Reform becomes too hard. You can have all the wake-up calls in the world, but you can also determinedly sleep through them.In some ways Tony Abbott is right to describe O’Farrell as ‘‘honourable’’ for falling so readily on his sword. It is true he has acted swiftly, decisively and apparently with the kind of accountability so few ministers are prepared to exhibit when scandal strikes. In a saner world this might be a sacrificial act that rehabilitates the nobility of politicians.But it is far from clear this will be the legacy of O’Farrell’s demise. Rather, this could become the moment that gave tangible expression to what so much of the electorate has already intuited: that there is something hopelessly compromised about the very culture of mainstream Australian politics.They’re all bad guys now. They’re all in it for themselves to the point they don’t even know - or simply can’t remember - when they’re breaching our trust. Clearly that’s not true at an individual level, but it doesn’t have to be if it becomes received wisdom. In short, we’re witnessing the slow motion desecration of the whole idea of politics.That’s what is behind this week’s Nielsen poll that showed voters abandoning both major parties, and seeking refuge in a resurgent Greens and a fledgling Palmer United Party. That’s why the same thing happened in the West Australian senate. Our political landscape now inspires such low esteem that the only place we can park our approval is on the margins: as far away from power as possible. The problem, though, is that no one ever governed from there.
