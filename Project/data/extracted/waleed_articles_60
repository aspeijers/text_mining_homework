**********Revenge: the CIA's new doctrine of torture********April 3, 2014******58**** Why do we torture? Ever since the CIA embarked upon its program of “enhanced interrogation techniques” we’ve had to reckon with that question. That means we’ve had to reckon with the assertion that it is, at least occasionally, justified. And in that connection, perhaps the high watermark was the 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden, which the CIA has always insisted was made possible only through its torture-by-another-name.That claim took something of a whack this week, when it emerged that a US Senate report has found torture delivered no key evidence that led ultimately to bin Laden’s death – and that the torture was worse than the public was ever allowed to know. Apparently whatever information turned out to be critical was extracted from standard interrogations, and whatever information came especially via torture wasn’t terribly important.In the American context, it’s a significant finding; one that goes to the heart of the Bush administration’s legacy rehabilitation project. Presently, Bush’s resort to torture stands as a kind of moral and political scar. If it can instead be presented as the key to killing bin Laden, then presumably all is not merely forgiven, but admired.So I understand the fight. And I understand the determination of (mainly Democrat, but also some Republican) senators to set the record straight. At stake is the legitimacy of torture, which would undermine the most foundational philosophical assumptions of open, liberal democratic government. But I can’t escape the feeling that some steps have been missed here; that the mere fact we’re even witnessing this argument reveals a remarkable, alarming shift in the public discussion of torture.At least until very recently, even the most brazen, hawkish justifications of torture have presented it as an emergency measure of last resort. The classic scenario is that of a ticking time bomb: you know a bomb is about to detonate at any moment; you know the person you’ve captured has information that will help you locate and defuse it; you know that the only way to get it out of them in time is to bring out the thumbscrews or attach electrodes to your detainee’s genitals. It’s a very carefully constructed setting that proceeds on the understanding that if there’s no life-threatening emergency there’s simply no justification because, with time up your sleeve, conventional interrogation techniques should yield all the information torture will, and probably more reliably.But even this highly concocted set-up has its problems. If the emergency is so pressing, and your detainee is so committed to his terrorism, he need only hold out for a short period of time. Or he need only give you enough incorrect information to stop the torture and send you chasing false leads until it’s too late. Then there’s the fact that in the real world, you don’t really have any way of knowing for sure that your detainee has the specific information you need to stop the explosion. Even if you knew for certain the detainee’s involved, once captured, you cannot be sure his information is up to date; that the plans haven’t been changed. It’s for these sorts of reasons (among others) that international law has long held that torture is never justified, even during national security emergencies.But it’s one thing to argue about ticking bombs. It’s something else altogether to argue the case for torture in the total absence of any specific emergency. And yet, that is what the bin Laden case ultimately boils down to. Sure, bin Laden was a dangerous man. But no one can be, or even is arguing that his killing prevented an imminent attack. Indeed it’s far from clear that his killing has reduced the terrorist threat at all. One of the great ironies of the American political debate is that the same politicians spruiking the benefits of torture seem to be the same ones warning us that – even in this post-bin Laden era – al-Qaeda is as dangerous as ever. “Al-Qaeda is in many ways stronger than it was before 9/11” declared New York Republican Peter King last year. It “poses a bigger threat to attack inside the US right now than it did before 9/11” added retiring Michigan Republican (and aspiring talk-radio host) Mike Rogers.The sheer lack of emergency here is evident even from the information said to have been unearthed. The most infamous concerns intelligence provided by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. This is a megalomaniacal character who confessed ridiculously to more than 30 terrorist plots including attacks on targets that didn’t exist at the time he was taken to Guantanamo Bay. This is also a man who was waterboarded a whopping 183 times – which is not something you can do in an emergency, and which is curious for the fact that his torturers clearly thought there was something to be gained on the 183rd occasion that couldn’t be on the 182nd. If torture is so good for extracting crucial information fast, why didn’t they get what they needed, say, by waterboarding 150?Certainly, it’s useful to know that torture didn’t propel the successful hunt for bin Laden. But the implicit question this raises is an important one: what if it did? Would that make torture a legitimate counter-terrorism norm, not in the case of emergency, but just as a matter of routine intelligence gathering? Do we not even need to ask any longer whether or not the same information – or even better information – might have been gathered through traditional methods? This, after all, is what the FBI has been insisting emphatically all along, much to the CIA’s annoyance.Or is it simply enough for us to say that because these are evil people they somehow deserve to be tortured? If so, then let’s at least let’s say so explicitly. And let’s acknowledge that we’re articulating a new doctrine of torture far more suited to the world’s most brutal autocrats: that we’ll torture for revenge.
**********Brandis' race hate laws are whiter than white********March 27, 2014******149**** Perhaps the most remarkable thing about George Brandis' now infamous comment this week that Australians "have the right to be bigots" is that it was so unremarkable. Sure, it's a grating sound bite, but as a matter of substance it's entirely obvious. Of course we have a right to be bigots. We always have.That's the point that has been buried here. Nothing in the Racial Discrimination Act as it presently stands precludes bigotry. In fact, I'll go a step further: you're even allowed to express your bigotry. Happens all the time. Read a newspaper. Bigoted views are published there several times in an average week.Two things flow from this. First, that critics of the Racial Discrimination Act are simply wrong to suggest that our free speech is so curtailed that we can't risk saying anything offensive. The courts have long made clear that the Act only contemplates serious cases. The caricature that we're placed at the mercy of the most delicate people's sensibilities is nothing less than a gross misrepresentation of the law.Second, that supporters of the Racial Discrimination Act are wrong if they insist it provides anything like substantial protection against racism. I've copped my share of racial abuse both in public and in private, and section 18C wasn't ever going to do a damn thing about it.So in the current furore, it's worth remembering that we're not exactly playing for cutthroat stakes. To be clear, the Abbott government's proposed legislation really would allow for almost any racist speech you can imagine. Any "public discussion of any political, social, cultural (or) religious" matter will be exempt, no matter how boneheaded, dishonest or odious.Precisely how it is possible to racially vilify someone without discussing a "social" matter is beyond me. But for all that, Australia will not simply explode in a blaze of white supremacy upon the repeal of these provisions (which is far from inevitable in any case).Rather, there is something else at stake here that is much bigger than any particular legislative provision. I'm not so much concerned by section 18C or its repeal, but by the mythology on which that repeal is apparently based. Unspoken at the heart of this debate is a contest over the way race relations works in this country – and on whose terms.That's what struck me most about the proposed legislation. It's just so . . . well, white. In fact it's probably the whitest piece of proposed legislation I've encountered during my lifetime. It trades on all the assumptions about race that you're likely to hold if, in your experience, racism is just something that other people complain about.Subsection (3) – mostly ignored to this point – is perhaps the most subtly revealing. Earlier subsections make it unlawful to do something that is "reasonably likely" to vilify or intimidate someone on the basis of race. But reasonably likely according to whom? Who gets to decide whether something is intimidating or vilifying? Subsection (3) provides the answer.Whether something is "reasonably likely" to vilify is "to be determined by the standards of an ordinary reasonable member of the Australian community", it begins. Fair enough. But then it adds in the most pointed way: "not by the standards of any particular group within the Australian community". That's code. It means, not by the standard of whatever racial minority is being vilified. Not the ordinary reasonable wog, gook or sand nigger; the ordinary reasonable Australian. And what race is this hypothetical "ordinary reasonable member of the Australian community" meant to be, exactly? If you answered that they have no particular race, then you've just given the whitest answer possible. It's the answer that assumes there is such a thing as racial neutrality. Of course, only white people have the chance to be neutral because in our society only white is deemed normal; only whiteness is invisible.Every other race is marked by its difference, by its conspicuousness – by its non-whiteness. White people are not non-Asians or non-blacks. They aren't "ethnic" as the term is popularly used. If the "ordinary reasonable Australian" has no race, then whether or not we admit it, that person is white by default and brings white standards and experiences to assessing the effects of racist behaviour. Anything else would be too particular.This matters because – if I may speak freely – plenty of white people (even ordinary reasonable ones) are good at telling coloured people what they should and shouldn't find racist, without even the slightest awareness that they might not be in prime position to make that call.This is particularly problematic with the proposed offence of racial "intimidation". To "intimidate" is "to cause fear of physical harm" according to the draft Act. Now our ordinary reasonable white person is being asked to tell, say, black people whether or not they are "reasonably likely" to be fearful of physical harm. Black people – reasonable ones – might actually be fearful, but ultimately a hypothetical white person will decide that for them.I have no doubt the Abbott government doesn't intend this. It doesn't need to. That's the problem. This is just the level of privilege we're dealing with. This is what happens when protection from racism becomes a gift from the majority rather than a central part of the social pact. It's what happens when racial minorities are required to be supplicants, whose claims to social equality are subordinate to those of powerful media outlets outraged they might occasionally have to publish an apology.And it's what happens when lawmakers and the culturally empowered proceed as though ours is a society without a racial power hierarchy simply because they sit at the top of it.

**********Game is as great as ever, and empires as avaricious********March 21, 2014******120**** It seems the good people of Sevastopol really want to be Russian. All 123 per cent of them turned out to vote in this week's referendum to say so.They're a fickle bunch, though. If they're anything like their fellow Crimeans, only about a third of them felt this way in 2011, and only a quarter still did last year. This week it's in the vicinity of 97 per cent. That's some turnaround, even if you allow for the fact that there was a mass boycott from anti-Russian residents, or that people armed with only a Russian passport were allowed to vote.So Crimea is now part of Russia - at least if you ask Vladimir Putin, who cheerfully annexed the peninsula in response. The West, of course, is apoplectic, branding all this illegal and imposing sanctions on Russia. And indeed, on one reading this is uniquely egregious.Not since World War II has anyone in Europe simply taken territory from a sovereign country. Russia has its pretexts - chief among them that the ethnic Russian population in Ukraine is facing persecution - but none led legitimately to swallowing another nation's land. Especially not after a dodgy referendum that gave a choice only between joining Russia and effective autonomy. If you wanted to remain part of Ukraine, you simply had no box to tick.The hypocrisy here is profound. When Kosovo held a referendum in 2008 to declare its independence from Serbia, the apoplexy was all Russia's. It didn't matter that this followed nine years of negotiations, during which time Kosovo was under international supervision. It didn't matter that the Kosovar people had endured dozens of massacres at Serbian hands as part of a dedicated ethnic cleansing campaign - a level of persecution that renders any comparison with the experience of Russian speakers in Ukraine simply ridiculous. Russia screamed this violated Serbia's territorial integrity, and that the United Nations was therefore obliged to declare the referendum void and impose "severe administrative measures" against Kosovar institutions.It's the same story Russia always tells, no matter how wretched the circumstances (see Syria). In the Russian view, a nation should be free to persecute as many of its own people as it pleases without having to deal with foreign interference. Sovereignty trumps all.Listen closely to Putin's words back in 2008: "The precedent of Kosovo is a terrible precedent, which will de facto blow apart the whole system of international relations, developed not over decades, but over centuries." Heavy stuff.Now it seems it's a precedent he's only too happy to follow, with interest. Putin's rhetoric must thus return to condemn him: he is not merely undermining Ukraine, or Western interests; he's undermining the entire international system. Any way you cut it, Putin is adopting a decidedly imperial pose.All of which would be scandalous if it weren't so common. The most tin-eared, self-unaware comment of this episode must still surely be US Secretary of State John Kerry's insistence that "you just don't in the 21st century behave in 19th century fashion by invading another country on a completely trumped-up pretext". Of course, this is perhaps the most eloquent description of America's 21st century invasion of Iraq that anyone has yet offered.Certainly, Iraq and Crimea are not identical. The biggest difference (aside from the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilian deaths) is that America was never going to annex Iraq. That is no longer America's style. But it would be naive to stop there - to accept at face value the suggestion that America therefore has no imperial impulses and operates as a modest nation-state, concerned merely with the administration of its own territory. The age of empire may formally have passed but that just means today's empires take a different form.Now they expand interests and project power through non-military means. They prop up compliant, unpopular, frequently dictatorial allies through copious aid. Elsewhere they fund civil society groups that non-allied governments regard as hostile. They build military and economic alliances with countries they feel a strategic need to have on their side.Ukraine is precisely such a country. Indeed, so are several of the former Soviet states that sit between Russia and Europe. This is why America has been so keen to bring them into NATO, thereby forging a military pact with them - the kind that was mobilised to pound Serbia in 1999. Russia fears the same thing could happen to it if NATO incorporates too many countries that sit on its borders. Russia openly regards this as an existential threat.So far NATO has coaxed Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. In time it hoped to add Georgia and Ukraine, thereby surrounding Russia. There's nothing random about America's designs here. And there's nothing random about Russia's determination to stop it, and expand its own alliances in Eurasia. This is an imperial game."I prefer Russia," says Sean Connery's character in The Russia House. "It's as corrupt as America, but there's less bullshit." That's about the size of it. When circumstances demand it, neither power cares much for the niceties of international law, and neither is meaningfully bound by it. Both aim to project their power as far as possible. But America's form of empire building is generally sophisticated enough to retain the veneer of normal international relations. Russia just goes ahead and annexes stuff.
**********Tony Abbott's plan is to have no plan at all********March 7, 2014******257**** We're beginning to run a touch low on icons. With Holden's demise now official, the focus this week has shifted to Qantas, which is so stuffed that its strategy is to approach the government for an unsecured loan of $3 billion.That, of course, was fanciful. Just how fanciful becomes clear when you consider that the Abbott government has now ruled out even providing a debt guarantee, which at least in the short term involves handing no money over at all. In fact, the government's only plan for Qantas seems to be the proposed legislation it has no hope of passing, which would allow it to seek greater foreign investment.''No plan B,'' screams the opposition. True enough, I suppose. But let us not be lured into thinking this points to a government with no ideas and no imagination. The absence of a plan here is something studied and deliberate. The Abbott government has a plan to have no plan and it's really committed to it.That's the whole point of neo-liberalism. It sees the world as a market and solves every problem through it. In this scheme, governments exist to keep the market running, not to develop elaborate plans for companies or industries. Thus, the Abbott government's response to the Qantas disaster is an entirely predictable one for a neo-liberal government to offer: remove as many market distortions as possible, then do nothing else.To be sure, the government hasn't been pristine on this. Just last week it gave money and access to favourable loans to drought-stricken farmers. Last year it blocked foreign investment in Graincorp. And, of course, there was the now infamous grant it pledged to Cadbury before the election. Indeed, there are still plenty of small business grants being given.But politics is always compromised to some degree and the political imperatives in such cases are typically clear, focused as they are on winning marginal seats or placating the Nationals. It's on the big cases that the government has been determined to make a statement. So with Qantas, as with Holden, Toyota and SPC Ardmona, the government is doing more than making policy decisions. It is articulating a philosophy. Plenty of people hate it, but that only proves that it's unmistakeable.Ideas, it seems, are back in Australian politics. In just six months in office, the Abbott government has discovered a level of philosophical clarity Labor couldn't manage in six years. This is a remarkable thing for a Coalition whose approach to opposition had almost nothing to do with ideology. Abbott's promiscuous opportunism delivered his party government, but also the fear that his would be a government with no direction. So much for that.The problem is that we don't really know where this road ends. The almost total absence of ideological contest in the past two elections has meant that we've never really debated this. At no point has the Coalition had to explain what its Australia would look like in, say, 30 years. What do we think our economy will look like, for instance? With so many traditional jobs and venerable companies passing into history, you might think it an urgent question. But the Coalition feels no need to answer it because neo-liberalism asks us to trust that the market will simply produce more efficient replacement jobs. No plan, remember? That's the plan.It's a lot of trust to place in a theory. And even if it works, it means a great deal of pain along the way for a great many people. This is what Labor is most keen to exploit. But even so, it has hardly unleashed the kind of withering attack that leaves the nation's ears ringing. A government surrounded by enough bad news to put it in serious trouble still has its head above water.That's because the government has managed to weave much of this bad news into a story. Its decisions are comprehensible, even if you instinctively detest them; coherent, even if galling. This is more or less the opposite of what Labor achieved in government, where, for example, it neglected its story on climate change to such an extent that by the time the carbon tax arrived it was discussed almost entirely in economic terms and viewed through the prism of political dishonesty.The result is that Labor can't so easily adopt the Abbott approach to opposition, which was to throw whichever punches were in reach, create a sense of chaos and declare the government illegitimate. Abbott could do that because Labor's narrative was never particularly clear, so it didn't need a more comprehensive or consistent riposte.By contrast, this government's stand against corporate support is easily grasped and stands as a broad guiding principle. Labor needs a counter-narrative of its own that the Coalition can't just dismiss as propping up failing businesses, but it's far from clear what that is.This reflects what is perhaps the biggest difference between the way the major parties do politics. Labor in power attempts to prove itself on the Coalition's terms, hence the obsessive and ultimately futile quest for a surplus. The Coalition simply pays no heed to Labor. That's what happens when only one side has clear ideological zeal. And so we have ideas in politics again. What we lack is an ideological contest.
**********The logic of PNG policy is sanctioned horror********February 21, 2014******96**** Sorry, but we don't get to be outraged at this. The fact that a person is now dead, that another has been shot or that yet another has a fractured skull doesn't change anything. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison is undoubtedly right when he describes this violent episode on Manus Island as a ''terrible tragedy''. In fact, he's more right than he knows. Tragedy, in the Greek sense, unfolds as an inevitability. The very thing that makes the tragic hero so tragic is that his fate is sealed, his demise is clear, but he continues to take every step that leads him there. And in the case of Manus Island, that is exactly where we are.We don't get to be outraged because this violence, with its brutal, deadly consequences, is inherent. We chose it, even if we've refused at every stage to acknowledge that. It is the very logic of our asylum seeker policy - which is built on the sole rationality of deterrence - to create horror. We're banking on it. That's emphatically the point. So now, let us make this calculus finally explicit: whatever these people are fleeing, whatever circumstance makes them think they'd be better off chancing death on boats hardly worthy of that description, we must offer them something worse. That something is PNG.The worse it is, the more effective it is destined to be, and the more it fulfils the philosophical intentions of the policy. Put simply, this tragedy is not any kind of evidence of policy failure. It is, in fact, the very best form of deterrence. This is what it looks like when the policy works.For now, we're busily piecing together exactly what happened. Hence the calls for an inquiry. We assemble the facts as a necessary ritual, but it's ultimately an irrelevance. If it turns out that these asylum seekers were set upon by the PNG police or by locals, what difference will it make? It will merely have demonstrated what we have long known: that PNG is a highly dangerous country, racked by lawlessness and violence.The capital, Port Moresby, is routinely listed among the least liveable cities on the planet. Last year, The Economist had it third worst, besting only Damascus and Dhaka, and therefore ranking below most of the cities these detainees have fled. And that's the reason the policy of transferring boat people to PNG is meant to work: because we're pointedly not offering these people protection if they're found to be refugees.And if the detainees are found to have triggered the violence? No doubt such a finding would be useful fodder for those determined to present them as villains, undeserving of our sympathy or protection. That, after all, is the narrative that surrounds asylum seekers whenever this sort of thing happens. But that only highlights an essential fact: this sort of thing keeps happening.Labor, unable to criticise the policy because it is theirs, can only present this death as some kind of managerial problem; as evidence that the Abbott government is mismanaging the centre. But riotous violence happened repeatedly on its watch, in Nauru and Villawood, as in Baxter and Woomera previously. Onshore, offshore, it didn't matter. Labor's objections - even in this utterly lame, limp form - are political and disingenuous.When social behaviour repeats itself like this, we have two explanations open to us. One is that this is a coincidence of sorts: that it is nothing more than the misbehaviour of immoral individuals gaming the system, and that these individuals merely happen to pop up repeatedly. This is very much the explanation favoured by officialdom - from both major parties - who immediately declare these rioters to have failed any decent character test, having revealed themselves as criminally inclined.The other explanation is that there is something about the circumstances of detainees that generates this behaviour. Put any group of people through this wringer, and they will eventually respond with riotous protest. Such behaviour, then, is not a function of the defective personalities of individuals, but the inevitable human reaction to inhuman treatment.Naturally, officials cannot abide this. Certainly, they are keen on talking about our ''system'', and preserving its integrity. But they present it as entirely passive; as a set of rules and processes that facilitate orderly management, rather than something active in its own right. As far as politicians are concerned, our systems don't have consequences.This, of course, is bollocks. But it's bipartisan bollocks, so for most relevant purposes it masquerades as truth. That's why we're blind to it. We respond to a detainee killed, but seem far less moved by the several to have committed suicide. Through it all we exonerate ourselves through the fiction that we played no part in their misery, or that those who riot are immorally cynical.But the cynicism is ours. Even the briefest sampling of commercial talkback radio this week revealed a streak within us that sees a detainee's death merely as comeuppance. The political truth is that there is almost nothing any government could do that the electorate would deem too brutal, which is precisely how we got here.A poll last month had 60 per cent of us urging the Abbott government to ''increase the severity'' of our policies towards asylum seekers. That's not a pragmatic policy judgment. We find something cathartic about this official form of violence.The truth is we've never really come to terms with why it is people get on boats, and why it is that, faced with hopeless inaction once they're detained, they protest. In fact, our public conversation isn't even terribly interested in knowing. That is why, when we do finally discover the facts of Manus, they will mean nothing.
**********James Foley beheading baits America to intervene********August 22, 2014******6**** "Without these videos and photos and firsthand experience, you can't really tell the world how bad it might be."  When you consider that these are the words of James Foley, the very same American journalist whose own brutish beheading at the hands of ISIS was this week filmed and posted online, it's about as chillingly foreboding as it gets.  Foley wanted us to know the horrors of Syria.  He devoted the last stage of his life to it.  But it is by his own horrific death that he has most shockingly told us how bad things might be.Now comes the search for meaning; for what this horror signifies.  The incorrigible extremism of ISIS, certainly.  But that much has already been proven at length as it has tried to perpetrate a genocide against local Yazidis, and routinely beheaded Christians.  And yet there is something different about this development that deserves our attention: something that reveals not merely ISIS's barbarism, but its weakness.When you are beheading locals, and stringing up the severed heads for public display, you're clearly doing more than killing people.  ISIS's rampant violence has thus far not merely been a campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide, but one more broadly of intimidation and control.  Certainly, it has wanted to exterminate non-Muslims.  But it has also been keen to eliminate Shiite Muslims and or even Sunnis it deems insufficiently obedient.  It has been trying desperately to assert authority over the territory it claims to control. The violence was public and local, with the very clear aim of gaining total compliance.This was ISIS in Jacobin mode; its post-revolutionary Régime de la Terreur.  In this respect at least ISIS was attempting to live up to its pretentious new brand: not as a group aspiring to a state, but as a state already achieved. Hence, "Islamic State", a rebranding that has always been dubious and was from the very start rejected even by its extreme Islamist cousins.  But at least it could plausibly lay claim to a serious chunk of territory straddling the Iraq-Syria border.  This was a movement on the march, whose advance had proven irresistible.Now there is resistance.  On the ground this has come in the form of the Iraqi military and especially Kurdish militias enjoying perhaps their first ever serious wave of international support.  From the air it has taken the form of US strikes, that have clearly pushed ISIS back from the Kurdish city of Erbil, and helped deliver the strategically crucial Mosul Dam into Kurdish hands.  For the moment, the Americans are pretty chuffed: "their morale is suffering, their competency and capacity has been damaged" declared the Pentagon press secretary this week.This could, of course, be the Obama administration's own spin.  But James Foley's execution suggests there is plenty of truth to it. This is not a local act of intimidation intended to establish and consolidate the power of a fledgling, self-declared state.  This is a global broadcast intended to draw a reaction from a global audience.  And it is this fact alone – far more than the literal content of the threats ISIS is making – that speaks volumes, here.  This week ISIS left behind its Jacobin pretensions and returned to its al-Qaedaist nature. It went from Terror (which is what the state does), to terrorism (which is what the militant without a state does).Thus are ISIS's motives abundantly plain.  It is doing what terrorist groups must do: recruiting.  And the best way to do that is to agitate and provoke; to radicalise the environment.  On this score, ISIS is treading an extremely well-worn path.  The aim is to put on a show of commitment and strength; something so confident and shocking that it will impress potential recruits. That's why Foley had to be humiliated before being killed.  It's why his death had to be gruesome.  It's a message calculated to give young radicalised Muslims a sense of power.  Indeed, we've seen this before – about a decade ago, from Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's al-Qaeda in Iraq.  As it happened, al-Zarqawi's campaign ended abruptly because it was hopelessly counterproductive.  It repulsed the very people it was intended to impress, and the al-Qaeda leadership pulled al-Zarqawi into line.  ISIS, as is frequently noted, is a more extreme incarnation of al-Qaeda, but it is hard to believe it would pursue this if it believed the practice would still be self-defeating.  So it must have reason to believe it will work differently this time.That reason is most likely that it is operating in radically different circumstances.  Ten years ago the US invasion was young and the carnage was fresh.  America's presence was a major radicalising force in itself, which had energised jihadists all over the world.  For al-Qaeda to behead civilians on film was merely for it to be gratuitous, and to compromise whatever moral appeal it claimed for itself.  But now, America has left.  Its present military reprise is very narrow and limited, nothing like the scale of shock and awe. Moreover it appears determined to keep it that way.That doesn't work for ISIS.  It needs America.  More to the point, it needs American intervention on a much grander scale.  However much it protests that it wants Obama to cease air strikes, it plainly seeks the opposite: to provoke the American public with something impossible to ignore, something so grotesque that it demands retaliation.  ISIS wants the American public screaming for Obama to escalate. It's about the oldest terrorist tactic there is.  Provoke overreaction, provide a magnet for radicalisation, swell the ranks and watch the cycle of violence unfold.  Indeed, this is precisely the story of the past decade or so.  James Foley's murder is about whether or not that will be the story of the next one.
