**********Unedifying campaigns are now the new norm********August 23, 2013******107**** Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott are formidably intelligent men who have subordinated their IQs to the crushing pragmatism of modern politics. Politicians have always done this to some degree but the fact it is being done so comprehensively this time tells us something far more important about our political culture than anything that will happen on September 7.Consider what this election is about. The Coalition's big-ticket items are a 1.5 per cent company tax cut and a paid parental leave scheme that is more than three years old. The government's biggest idea came on day one: $500 million more in funding for the car industry. Since then it has run a bizarre campaign against a GST increase no one is proposing and which Abbott has ruled out in emphatic terms, and peppered the opposition with questions about its costings.These issues aren't entirely trivial. But if they are the grandest questions we're being asked to consider in this campaign, we're clearly in a world of micro-politics - a world where the controversies are over small matters of detail rather than large questions of vision. I can summarise the parry and thrust: the arguments each side is deploying against the other, and which ones are going unanswered. But what I cannot do, is tell you what either party would like Australia to look like in 30 years: what they think should be transformed, what should be forgone and what should be preserved.That couldn't be said of 2007, when John Howard tried to change industrial relations like never before and Rudd spoke fluently about responding to climate change and tackling the skills shortage. Both leaders told us what they thought was wrong with the country and how they'd go about fixing it. That campaign had its vacuous features - Grocery Watch comes to mind - but the stakes were far from confected. This year's campaign is much more like 2010, when the parties competed in telling us how much they didn't like population growth while both supported remarkably expansionary immigration programs, and when Labor's climate change policy was to have none and ask the punters to figure it out in the form of a citizens' assembly. Everyone lamented 2010. That campaign became shorthand for politics at its most substance-free and uninspiring. Now it has some competition. We should be genuinely alarmed that such Seinfeldian history is repeating because now we have reason to ask if this is a permanent condition.I fear it is. In saying this, I'm aware that we're in unusual times. Twice now we've had a change of prime minister on the eve of the campaign. We've had minority government for three years. But these circumstances, too, are products of the age. In the same time that two prime ministers have been axed, so has a Victorian premier and a chief minister in the Northern Territory. It's both sides of politics and it's happening with outrageous speed.I see two reasons for our malaise. The first is our incurable tendency to view politics in terms of personal cost and benefit. We in the media promote this every year when we present the budget as the answer to the question ''what's in it for you?'' Politicians reinforce it with every handout to people who don't need it, every opportunistic tirade on behalf of anyone who loses an entitlement and with every contrived attempt to ''feel our pain'' about the cost of living, when our real incomes have been rising for years (just not as quickly as our material demands). The end result is an approach to reform that means everyone must win all the time: a politics that pretends not to be about choices and trade-offs. Thus, when Labor wanted to reform education funding, it had to promise no one would be worse off - even the richest, best-resourced schools. Hence Gonski's massive bill, which Abbott, of course, has eventually agreed to pay. But it is precisely this political logic - where we are trained to see ourselves as clients of the state - that prevent him from detailing costings that will inevitably create losers, at least until the last feasible moment.The second problem is about how we communicate. Much has been written about the 24-hour news cycle and its hollowing out of politics to a series of grabs and slogans. All that is true, but I think the problem is more comprehensive than that. Truth be told, not all political coverage is shallow and this campaign has seen something of a renewed rigour. Fact-checking projects are the new fashion (see Fairfax, the ABC and The Conversation). The ABC is running a Vote Compass that plots your own political persuasion against the policy positions of the three biggest political parties. You can compare yourself with them issue by issue. If you look around you'll find maps showing the leaders' every move around the country. In short, there's more information, more readily available to voters, than ever.These are welcome, even exciting initiatives, especially for the politically engaged. But we're naive to think they will affect politicians' behaviour, or in any other way rescue our politics from its present shallowness. The problem of our age is that we have too much information and nowhere near enough time or wisdom to evaluate it. So we have little choice but to select those things that most arouse our particular obsessions.Perhaps it's the intricacies of Rudd's pink batts scandal. Perhaps it's the precise size of the savings the Coalition will have to find to fund its promises. Either way it will most likely be microscopic because the more information we have, the harder it is to organise it around a few compelling themes. That is the job of politicians. But big ideas have a habit of creating losers they dare not talk about. The circle completes itself.
**********There's a paradox at the heart of the PNG plan********July 26, 2013******2**** There's something about the font that dominates the federal government's new asylum seeker policy advertisements. Something about the harsh stencilling effect and the rough black markings that punctuate the stark, white letters. It's like it's forged from metal: rugged, weathered, ultimately indestructible. ''You won't be settled in Australia''. It doesn't scream it. It simply declares it with a kind of closed-minded, bureaucratic rigidity. It's not advising you. It's telling you, in a shockingly impersonal ''access denied'' sort of way. There's no point yelling back at it, because there's no one to yell at.That makes it tough. It's more than an affectation: it's a philosophy. The grammar of our public conversation simply assumes an asylum seeker policy must be tough to be effective. And since a policy of total exclusion is about as tough as it gets, this policy is as effective as it gets.This line of reasoning, it seems, is invincible. This week we learnt that PNG Prime Minister Peter O'Neill wanted asylum seekers ''to move around freely within the community'' rather than be confined to what, if Dateline  is to be believed, is a hellhole of a detention centre. That hellhole was our idea because we've made harshness the very point, the very mark of successful policy. That's why the opposition can find no criticism of the government's new policy as a matter of principle, and has resorted instead to posing with retired major generals and talking about stopping boats with a 3-star military commander. Exactly what that commander will do is unclear, and isn't the point. The point is that it is so tough it looks and sounds like war.But the austere facade masks the fact that this reasoning is an entirely closed loop. For all our harshness, the boats have kept coming. But instead of taking stock, we decide this means we simply need to be harsher. So even as another boat sinks bound for Christmas Island, claiming eight lives, it serves only as proof that such toughness is necessary - in Rudd's language, it ''underlines the need for policy changes''. Certainly it's not evidence that the policy might not work: ''We also said that the people smugglers would in fact try to test our resolve,'' said Rudd in response to this boat. He'll say the same after every boat that sinks on his watch.That's the great paradox at the heart of this policy. It is justified entirely by the fact that it will work, but there is no way to demonstrate its failure. On its own terms it is utterly unfalsifiable. If the boats come in hordes, they're simply testing our resolve, which means we must stick with the plan and never give up. To do so would no doubt send a terrible ''message'' to people smugglers. This is a perpetual policy, impervious to data. At what point could we declare the policy a failure? At no point, if you believe the government. However many people arrive, that's how many we'll need to send away. And send them we will, because we have ''resolve''.All this would be fine if we were talking about an assumption that was undeniably true, or this were a policy of little human consequence. But we're not. We're talking about a supposition that deterrence is the only available means to stop people drowning at sea, and we're talking about deterrence measures that, frankly, destroy people: that lead them to suicide, self-harm, and as we learnt this week, being victims of rape. And for all that, still they come. Whatever the threshold of deterrence, it must be extraordinarily high. High enough that the prospect of death by drowning isn't even enough. But instead of questioning whether such hyper-deterrence is really possible, we keep reaching higher and higher for it.The central problem is that our public debate has never really come to grips with why it is people are coming on these boats. There's the rhetoric of queue-jumping, country shopping and evil people smugglers, but this is more bluster than insight. And you can see the confusion in Rudd's PNG solution. Once you get beyond the assertions about the people smugglers' ''product'' and ''business model'', a huge unanswered question remains: exactly who does the government think these boat people are?To say we can stop the boats by resettling their passengers in PNG is to say one of two inescapable things. First, that the boats will stop because these boat people are not really seeking protection from persecution, and are instead only after Australian residency; thus PNG (or anywhere else) will never do, even though it offers protection, simply because it isn't Australia. But that is to say they aren't really refugees. That doesn't square with the fact that the overwhelming majority of asylum seekers get refugee status.Alternatively we're saying the boats will cease because PNG is such a ghastly place so incapable of offering protection that a genuine refugee will refuse to go there. If that's the case, then we're clearly breaching the international obligations we're pretending to uphold by sending them somewhere incapable of protecting them.The government will accept neither of the interpretations I've given above, but seriously, what other interpretation is there? I've tried for days, and I can't think of one. Even its own explanation takes us nowhere. It says that whatever the case, people smugglers are offering resettlement in Australia: that is the ''product'' we're removing. But that's simply not enough. The question now is: what if they offer a different product, namely resettlement in PNG? Will they not take that? If not, why not?If we assume, as the data suggests, that asylum seekers are overwhelmingly genuine refugees, then there's simply no guarantee this will stop the boats. But even if it does, what exactly will we have achieved? We will say we've saved countless lives at sea. But we will also have done something else: left them with no option but one as bad as what they currently have. The option they think is worse than taking the risk of death. The option that is not outweighed even by the stories of abuse, suicide and mental illness in detention. The option that means they simply aren't offered protection at all.

**********Mursi: now a symbol of democratic failure********July 12, 2013******96**** Suppose Egypt held free and fair presidential elections tomorrow. Suppose Mohammed Mursi was free to contest, and suppose he won. What then? Would the millions of protesters who urged the military to depose him be suddenly converted? And if not, what would we make of their cries, knowing as we would that despite their impressive numbers, they represent an electoral minority?The fact is that if such an election were held tomorrow, it would take someone very brave, or very partisan, to guarantee Mursi would lose. And yet the military holds him under arrest, ostensibly on behalf of the people.There's no doubting the popular impetus for this but let's not pretend this is anything other than a military coup. The millions of Egyptians cheering the military's action don't change that. There's a difference between something that is popular and something that is democratic. And democratic change doesn't occur pre-emptively with the help of tanks.Democratic principles don't get more fundamental than that.It's important to be clear on this point because for decades the great fear of Middle Eastern democracy has been that it would deliver an Islamist government that would then proceed to dismantle that very same democracy. "One man, one vote, one time," goes the saying. But the rich irony is that so much of the region's recent history points in the opposite direction, where a secular military has attempted (sometimes successfully) to subvert Islamist democracy. Think Turkey. Or Algeria. Now, Egypt.The problem with this line of thinking has always been that it plays to Islamism's strongest, and most dangerous, suit. It deprives Islamists of all democratic hope and positions them as liberators against an authoritarian regime. Islamist politics always works best in opposition, when it can talk the language of resistance and not be held to the test of delivering on its ideals.Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood can now talk that language once more. Its take-home message now seems to be that the entire system of democratic governance is stacked against it. Even when it wins, it loses. As the Algerian experience shows, that is hugely dangerous. In that case, the military dissolved parliament and annulled elections once the Islamist party looked set to win. The result was a decade-long Islamist insurgency that took about 150,000 lives.Now consider the Brotherhood's next move. Already it has decried "the repressive practices of the police state" and declared it will "refuse to participate in any action with power usurpers". It can't see its way to being involved in the political transition because it rejects the very fact of its existence. Maybe it will change its mind but what if it doesn't? Does anyone seriously expect it will give up on its pursuit of power after more than 80 years of trying and only one year of authority? More likely it will continue its involvement in politics by other, less democratic or conventional means.The fall of Hosni Mubarak was such a monumental moment in the region's history because it sent two colossal messages. First, that autocrats could be removed by the mobilisation of ordinary people without resorting to the revolutionary violence Islamist movements often declared necessary. Second, that if Islamists wanted political influence, they could have it by buying into the democratic process. In a stroke it seemed militant Islamism had run its course, having achieved no revolutionary change in its decades of carnage and having been left behind by the democratic impulse of the masses.As much could be seen in al-Qaeda's limp reaction to the uprisings. It was compelled to celebrate the fall of these dictators but could claim none of the credit. But in the past week, both these messages have been undermined.It's not true to say Egypt is simply back where it started two years ago. With what looks suspiciously like the military firing on a crowd of Islamist protesters in prayer, and with the Brotherhood leadership arrested, the truth is the country has now gone backwards. Then it was at least unified by a dream. Now it is hopelessly divided, apparently without even the most basic agreement that its differences will be resolved periodically at elections. Mursi made some enormous mistakes. Perhaps his first was to nominate for president in the first place when the Brotherhood promised it would not field a candidate.Once in power, he promised an economic recovery that was never going to happen. He issued, then retracted, a decree that made his executive decisions above the scrutiny of the courts and shoved through a constitution (via a hasty referendum) with an unnecessarily partisan flavour.This immediately alienated those sectors of society not sympathetic to his cause, guaranteeing a political environment of perpetual suspicion and protest. And that's to say nothing of the violence against religious minorities that occurred on his watch.But he should have been allowed to crash at an election. He might then have ended up a symbol of the Brotherhood's political failure. Now, to many, he'll be a symbol of democratic failure, with all that entails. In the meantime, the depth of Egyptian division means those who called for Mursi's head will eventually start calling for each other's, while the depth of its economic disaster (which was hardly Mursi's making) means no new president will be its saviour. If so, we'll be left to ask precisely what has been gained by all this. What will be much clearer, though, is what has been sacrificed.
**********Fresh fire but using Gillard's ammo********June 28, 2013******252**** Do you have that hollow feeling, too? That feeling that after months, no, years of build-up, after the arrival of the final climax, there is something oddly underwhelming about the fact that Kevin Rudd has finally reclaimed the throne? It's not that this isn't a momentous development. It is. But after the incessant focus on whether or not this would happen, we're left with the question so many Labor MPs couldn't answer while they were vainly denying anything was going on: what exactly was that about?It certainly wasn't about integrity. Julia Gillard's magnificent concession speech revealed the person the public so rarely saw, but that her loyal colleagues clearly knew. This is very much unlike Rudd's axing in 2010, which we now know was mainly about Rudd's impossibly dysfunctional style of governance, which led much of the caucus to detest him. Gillard's colleagues like and respect her, but in the final act simply couldn't abide her diabolically bad polling. No doubt the data reflected her constant political missteps, but they also reflected Rudd's constant undermining of her. Now the man who contributed so much to making her prime ministership impossible, who has done so much to put Labor in this catastrophic position, has been rewarded with the leadership. He held the party to ransom, and ultimately got paid.This was sheer, bloody pragmatism. There's no central policy dispute or matter of principle at stake. Listen carefully to Bill Shorten's statement half an hour before the ballot: ''I have now come to the view that Labor stands the best chance to defend the legacies of this term of government, and to continue improving the lives of millions of Australians if Kevin Rudd is our leader,'' he explained. The emphasis is mine, but if you think about them, the italicised words are astonishing. The legacy he's protecting is Gillard's. His support for Rudd was, paradoxically, all about his admiration for the woman he helped eject from politics, a prime minister who has "accomplished remarkable things'' - ''once-in-a-generation reforms'' no less, and ''in very difficult circumstances in a minority government''.That's one of the great ironies here. For now, the electorate clearly prefers Rudd to Gillard, and that's the only reason we now have him. But in policy terms, Gillard has the more impressive record. Rudd's time in office was frantic, but barren. Beyond his great symbolic moments (the apology and Kyoto), his biggest initiatives, such as the emissions trading scheme and his mining tax, fell over. His education revolution amounted to little - far less than Gillard's Gonski-inspired initiative. Gillard has her name on the national disability insurance scheme, the carbon tax and a newly negotiated, if deeply flawed, mining tax. She achieved a health funding deal with the states where Rudd couldn't. She has established a landmark wide-ranging royal commission on child sex abuse. Some of these (health, mining tax) were renewed, compromised versions of Rudd's failures. Others, (carbon tax, royal commission) were not her idea and were forced upon her. Still, her legacy is far more concrete than Rudd's.Rudd's one virtue is that he gives Labor the spectre of a chance in this year's election. Not necessarily even the chance to win so much as the chance not to be utterly destroyed. That's why his caucus supporters rarely have glowing things to say about him. Foreign Minister Bob Carr was more spirited on Lateline, celebrating Rudd as ''the leader who saved us from the GFC''. No doubt, that was Rudd's great practical achievement in office. But that was a response to circumstances, not an agenda.What is his agenda now? We know Rudd has long wanted the leadership, but to what end? The most emphatic reason he gave was to ''do what I can to prevent Mr Abbott from becoming prime minister''. Then came Shorten: "I believe that Tony Abbott and his conservative Coalition represent a once-in-a-generation risk to the advancement of this nation and its peoples''. Then came Carr: "Too much is at risk … [it's] overwhelmingly in Australia's interest that Tony Abbott not be our national leade''. It's no longer about what Labor will do. It's a little bit about what Labor has done - almost entirely under Gillard. But it's mostly about their stopping their opponents. Umpteen Labor voices have declared the importance of offering the Australian people a choice this year. But it's not yet clear exactly what that choice will be other than a choice between a man named Tony Abbott, and someone who isn't.The upshot is this: we're now witnessing a contest between two opposition leaders. More than that, it's a contest between the two best opposition leaders we have seen in decades. Rudd's 2007 dismantling of Howard was so clinical and thorough that he looked destined forever to be a Labor hero. Abbott hasn't so much dismantled Rudd and Gillard as destroyed them. But the fact both men are skilled in opposition is scarcely encouraging. It means both excel in the symbolism and sharply crafted critique that opposition rewards. But as Rudd so spectacularly demonstrated after 2007, opposition and government are entirely different enterprises.What we don't have is a leader. We don't have a government that can run energetically on its record, because while his colleagues might celebrate the NDIS and Gonski, Rudd simply doesn't own them, and will surely look ridiculous spruiking them. This is, in some ways, a re-run of 2010, when Gillard had no way of owning Rudd's economic management, so we didn't talk about it. The result that time was perhaps the most substance-free election campaign we've ever seen; one characterised by small ideas and mutual scare tactics. We might just be headed there again.

**********Young Turks bring refreshing shade of grey to nation's black and white divide********June 14, 2013******33**** You know something extraordinary is happening when sworn enemies are locking arms in solidarity. And right now in Turkey, something extraordinary is happening. Ultra-nationalists are uniting with the very Kurdish activists, whose rights they have so long denied, to face together the tear gas and water cannons the police are unleashing on them.Beside them are seasoned opposition supporters and young, urban Turks, children and adolescents, many of them with very shallow histories of political engagement.''Those who wanted to kill each other last week became - no exaggeration - comrades on the streets,'' wrote Turkish journalist Ece Temelkuran in New Statesman.The most transformational protests are often the product of wildly varied groups who agree on little except what they hate. Indeed that was very much the story of the Arab uprisings that continue to reverberate across the region. These protests are not quite of that revolutionary moment. There is no prospect of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan being toppled. Even if he were it would hardly be the collapse of a decades-old dictatorship. But these protests are revolutionary in a different way. This might be the moment the fault lines of Turkish politics are radically recast.Until now, those fault lines have been abundantly clear. The classic power struggle is between what Turks often call ''White Turks'' and ''Black Turks'': a secular elite, led by the army, who see themselves as the defenders of Ataturk's nationalist legacy, and the more traditional, religiously inclined masses. The racial imagery is deliberate. White Turks are meant to be the equivalent of our own WASPs. They are socially empowered, overwhelmingly urban, wealthier and better educated.They have Western lifestyles, adopt Western modes of dress and drink Western alcohol. They also tend to look down on ''blacks'' as unrefined because of their religious commitments and cultural conservatism. The divide is bitter, enduring and never far from the surface.When one professor of international relations was asked this week about the rapidly changing nature of Istanbul as more upwardly mobile Black Turks take jobs there, he told The New York Times the city had ''been invaded by Anatolian peasants'' he regarded as ''uncultured''.Erdogan has scarcely pretended to be a unifying figure. ''Your brother Tayyip belongs to the Black Turks,'' he famously declared about 15 years ago. Little wonder the military has long wanted to destroy him.In 2008, for instance, it went to the Constitutional Court and asked it to ban Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) on the basis it was ''a focal point of anti-secular activities'' and was ''trying to turn the country into an Islamic state''.The case was lost, but the audacity of it was telling: This was nothing less than an attempt to remove a democratically elected government that only the previous year had won in a landslide. But this was merely an attempt to replicate its ''postmodern coup'' of a decade earlier, when it shut down the Islamist Welfare Party which had just formed a coalition government. Since 1960, the military has also carried out three more traditional coups. In its zeal to preserve Turkey's secular nationalism, the military has long arrogated to itself the power to subvert the democratic will.That has always been the basis of Erdogan's legitimacy. Whatever the secular elite want to say about him, and whatever threats the military wanted to make, he had the people demonstrably on his side.Erdogan has won elections for 10 years, and winning emphatically. The military had inherited privilege and an ideology to support it, but no popular mandate. This only became more important when Turkey's tilt at EU membership required it to enhance its democratic credentials and establish civilian control over the military. A Herculean task, but Erdogan carried it off.The high-water mark is surely the successful constitutional referendum held on the highly symbolic date of September 12, 2010 - exactly 30 years after the 1980 military coup. This sent military power into serious retreat because among its suite of reforms it abolished the legal protection enjoyed by coup leaders. Plotting a coup would be a crime against the state, prosecuted in civilian courts. This was perhaps the most significant liberal democratic reform in Turkey's history, and it left the military nowhere to go.It's a story that confounds Western notions that secularism is always liberal and freedom-enhancing, and religious politics is always on the side of authoritarianism. Here, authoritarianism was secularism's handmaiden. To be liberal and democratic was to vote with the Black Turks. But now that story is starting to unravel. Now Erdogan is the one striking a dictatorial pose. After a period of remarkable improvement - marked by a significant decline in torture and the recognition of the cultural rights of the Kurdish minority - Turkey's human rights record is regressing.Turkey now has more journalists in prison than any other country, for instance. Many of them haven't been charged. A mandatory internet filtering regime is in place. Opposition politicians and human rights lawyers have been arrested and imprisoned. Now they're gassing protesters.''They are drunk with power,'' one academic observer says of Erdogan's government. ''They lost their democratic reflexes and are returning to what is the essence of Turkish politics: authoritarianism.''That's what these protests - which began with a sit-in against a planned shopping mall - are really about. The old secular/religious division is falling away now. There are not just White Turks and Black Turks any more. Amid the diverse fray we're witnessing the arrival of something Turkish politics has never really seen but desperately needs.Meet the Grey Turks: young, urban, well educated, not necessarily secular, but definitely democratic.
