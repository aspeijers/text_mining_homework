**********Republicans to struggle with crisis they created********October 4, 2013******0**** Contrary to obvious appearances, the Republicans in Congress who this week forced the US government into a coma are not insane. That doesn't mean this wasn't an insane result. It was, on almost every level. That includes the level of pure politics, with polling showing predictably that the American people see no need for this mess, and even Republicans acknowledging that the electorate will blame them, not President Obama.They know this because that's what happened the last time they tried this in the mid-'90s, handing Bill Clinton a political gift he took all the way to a landslide victory in 1996. The Republicans are not merely holding a gun to the nation's head; they're holding one to their own.But that doesn't make individual Republicans ''lemmings with suicide vests'', as one of their own described them. It's not that simple. As individuals, Republican politicians are embracing this insanity for perfectly sane reasons. And that's the problem. The political system is now such that Republicans keep their jobs by making the party as a whole increasingly unelectable.This week's farce has its roots in 2010 when Republicans swept their way to majorities in both houses of Congress. It was a stunning return from exile, after Democrats had banished them from every limb of the government in 2008. But then Republicans tried to entrench their position through a colossal gerrymander. Several Republican-controlled states proceeded to redraw their electoral boundaries to make Democrat success nigh on impossible. And it worked. By 2012, results in the House of Representatives were so skewed that the Republicans comfortably maintained their majority despite Democrat candidates receiving more than a million more votes.Take Pennsylvania, where Democrats won nearly 51 per cent of the vote, but Republicans won 13 seats to five. Or Michigan where the Democrat vote was nearly 53 per cent while Republicans took almost twice as many seats. North Carolina: 51-49 to the Democrats but nine Republican seats to a paltry four. And on it goes. That sort of result landed in at least 10 states - only one of which was rigged to favour the Democrats. To get a sense of the scale of it, consider that in the seven states redrawn by Republicans, near parity voting (16.7 million votes to 16.4 million) delivered 73 Republicans and 34 Democrats.That's a clear perversion of democracy and it's no accident. Indeed the Republican State Leadership Committee made it explicit. They ran a $30 million project called Redmap, aimed at winning key seats at the state level, which would give them the power to draw electoral boundaries. What's more, they planned to do this in a census year so they could draw with precision - 2010 was exactly such a year.So the plan worked. They played the system. But now the system is playing them. Sure, Republicans look set to control the House well into the future. But in the American system, the political contest doesn't simply vanish. It shifts to the primaries. Now if you're a Republican House member, your greatest threat comes not from Democrats, but from other Republican challengers hungry for your seat. The result is that Republicans are talking more and more to their own base, and less and less to everyone else. It's the rational thing for a politician to do. Even if that base is becoming increasingly irrational.Old-school Republicans might shake their heads at the rising rabidity of their Tea Party colleagues, but the truth is they're currently no match for them. The last thing aspiring congressional Republicans need is a well-funded lobby group running campaigns lacerating them as closet socialists. Freed from the need to defeat any meaningful Democrat challenge, Republican politics is now such that everyone's racing to outbid each other for the mantle of true believer. It's a classic case of a closed system encouraging ever more radical posturing.It doesn't get much more radical than trying to bring the government down. And that's the real concern here: what if this isn't really about Obamacare at all? What if the government shutdown itself is the goal? Truth be told, Republican candidates have been talking about doing this since 2010. Back then it was just as likely about budget cuts - ''a down payment on fiscal sanity'' is that well-worn Republican phrase. Either way the subtext has always been the same: that shutting down the government would be a good thing; it would not usher in the kind of dysfunction that, say, in a country like ours happens once in 100 years and causes a government to be dismissed.America's problem is even more serious than it now appears. America is now two artificially created countries, operating in parallel. There's the country that chooses presidents and the one that can only rail righteously against them. The country where funding the government is a matter of sensible routine and the country where shutting down the government is a badge of pride, a slogan you can sell.The Republican Party is going to have to figure out which country it wants to rule because these countries cannot be reconciled. They won't be until every state hands over the power to draw electoral boundaries to an independent, non-political body. In the meantime, the Republican Party is trapped in a bubble largely of its own making.
**********Learning the limits of small l-liberalism********September 20, 2013******0**** When acting opposition leader Chris Bowen quipped this week that there were now more women in Afghanistan's cabinet than Australia's, he must have known the line would stick. In fact, it seems to have inspired an entire genre of commentary. Witness Steph Harmon's viral post on Junkee listing "Things That Have More Women In Them Than Tony Abbott's Cabinet": Zoo Weekly's staff meeting; the Saudi Arabia Olympics Team; the Iranian cabinet; Tony Abbott's immediate family. And on it goes. One bright spark on Twitter pointed out that Julia Gillard's first cabinet had more prime ministers than Abbott's has women.It's funny. It's sharp. It's a point amusingly and efficiently made. That is until you stop and think about it. Beyond the clear rhetorical effect, what actually is the point? That this cabinet is embarrassingly male? Sure. But then what? What precise conclusion about this is being urged upon us?I suspect the conclusion is all about Tony Abbott. This, you sense, is the anti-Abbott sector's smoking gun, the evidence that proves his sexism once and for all. "He simply cannot accept women as equals and can only relate to them â€¦ as wives, mothers and daughters," declares Tim Dunlop in The Drum, neatly capturing this approach. I very much doubt Bowen is suggesting women's interests are less represented in Australia than in Afghanistan. But I have little doubt he's prodding us to wonder whether Abbott would change that if he had his way. The point is to present Abbott as the ultimate regressive: the misogynist homophobe from yesteryear trying desperately to drag us back to some darker age. That's why Labor is so keen to point out that Abbott's is the first cabinet without a dedicated science minister since 1931.This brand of argument is pointless for at least two reasons. First, it has been thoroughly agitated by Abbott's foes for years now. A couple of weeks ago the nation either rejected it as untrue or deemed it an irrelevance. That Abbott has kept his male-dominated shadow cabinet largely in place - pretty much as he said he would - is unlikely to cause Australians to revise their judgment wildly.But second (and most importantly) it misses the point. This isn't about Tony Abbott. It's much bigger than that. It's not even just about gender. There's a broader philosophy at work here that calls into question our society's ability to deal with disadvantage of just about any kind."I never want to see affirmative action," affirmed Bronwyn Bishop in defence of Abbott's cabinet choices. She recounted her struggle to become a NSW senator when no woman had done so previously. "They didn't choose me then but I didn't go away and whinge about it either. I just worked hard so they chose me subsequently."It's a neat, if austere theory of success that comes very much from the Liberal Party's philosophical heart. Hard work is rewarded. Success is in the hands of the individual. This is why Bronwyn Bishop maintains Julia Gillard's misogyny speech was "disgraceful": because it "was playing the victim". This view of society doesn't see victims - at least not on the basis of, say, gender, race or class. It sees individuals who bear the responsibility of their own plight.This is the downside of liberalism, where society is boiled down to individuals and the choices they make. This promises equality of a sort, because it prevents, say, an individual from a despised minority from having to conform to the majority's prejudice. But this also means society's most powerful people are freed from the claims of its least powerful. So women might be free to break the bonds of their traditional gender roles, but if they find they're excluded from the most senior positions by an informal boys' club, then liberalism will probably have little to offer them. After all, these boys are free to associate informally, and barring the most overt discrimination, are free to work with whomever they fancy. Liberalism might save you from formalised slavery, but it will hardly storm the barricades of inherited privilege. In fact, it hardly notices them.This is a quandary facing any liberation movement in a liberal society, of which feminism is only the most newsy example of the moment. Part of the agenda is always to maximise choice, which is why freedom of choice is probably our society's most definitive value. Liberalism has been a useful tool for claiming rights. But the logic on which that rests ultimately keeps glass ceilings in place. Choice is the opposite of coercion. And only coercion is likely to shatter the glass.It's not hard to find senior businessmen who will extol the virtues of more women in senior business roles, for instance. Some can even point to the obstacles to this utopia - such as the absence of suitable childcare arrangements. But ask them to pay more tax to fund those arrangements and they'll laugh at you. Ask them to take on a quota and they might even fume. After all, it compromises their freedom of choice. But if we make these choices from vastly unequal positions, then on balance, the interests of the powerful are likely to prevail, and the status quo proceeds mostly undisturbed. That's not a matter of a sexist individual here and there. It's a matter of structural disadvantage.That's why so few women are on our top corporate boards, despite the mountains of research showing companies with diverse boards will do better. It's why the faces on our televisions - or indeed in our Parliament - remain overwhelmingly white even as our society has become hypercoloured. And it's why, for all the lamenting of the absence of women in Abbott's cabinet, that cabinet is still able to make history by appointing Julie Bishop Australia's first female foreign minister.Clearly, that history is easy to make. It will remain that way as long as we have no language to talk other than one of choice and freedom; as long as our politics becomes about individual leaders and the choices they make rather than the broader questions of the way our society works. So many of those presently railing at Abbott would probably, proudly describe themselves as small-l liberals. But would they understand the limits of what they're saying?
**********Egyptians have sacrificed so much and gained so little********July 12, 2013******0**** Suppose Egypt held free and fair presidential elections tomorrow. Suppose Mohammed Mursi was free to contest and, suppose he won. What then? Would the millions of protesters who urged the military to depose him be suddenly converted? And if not, what would we make of their cries, knowing that despite their impressive numbers, they represent an electoral minority?The fact is that if such an election were held tomorrow, it would take someone very brave, or very partisan, to guarantee Mursi would lose. And yet the military is holding him under arrest, ostensibly on behalf of the people.Democratic change does not occur pre-emptively with the help of tanks. It's important to be clear on this point because for decades the fear of Middle Eastern democracy was that it would deliver an Islamist government that would proceed to dismantle that very same democracy. It may be "one man, one vote, one time", but the irony is that much of the region's recent history points in the opposite direction, where a secular military has attempted (sometimes successfully) to subvert Islamist democracy. Think Turkey. Or Algeria.Unfortunately this line of thinking plays to Islamism's strongest, and most dangerous, suit. It deprives Islamists of democratic hope and positions them as liberators against an authoritarian regime. Islamist politics works best in opposition, when it can talk the language of resistance and not be held to the test of delivering on its ideals.Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood can now talk that language once more. Its take-home message seems to be that the entire system of democratic governance is stacked against it. Even when it wins, it loses. As the Algerian experience shows, that is dangerous. In that case, the military dissolved parliament and annulled elections once the Islamist party looked likely to win. The result was a decade-long Islamist insurgency that took about 150,000 lives.Now consider the Brotherhood's next move. Already it has decried "the repressive practices of the police state" and declared it will "refuse to participate in any action with power usurpers".The fall of Hosni Mubarak was such a monumental moment in the region's history because it sent two messages. First, that autocrats could be removed by the mobilisation of ordinary people without resorting to the revolutionary violence Islamist movements often declared necessary. Second, that if Islamists wanted political influence, they could have it by buying into the democratic process. In a stroke it seemed militant Islamism had run its course, having achieved no revolutionary change in its decades of carnage and being left behind by the democratic impulse of the masses. This much could be seen in al-Qaeda's limp reaction to the uprisings. It was compelled to celebrate the fall of these dictators but could claim none of the credit. But in the past week, both these messages have been undermined.It's not true that Egypt is back where it started two years ago. With what looks suspiciously like the military firing on a crowd of Islamist protesters in prayer, and with the Brotherhood leadership arrested, instead it's the country that has gone backwards.Before it was at least unified by a dream, now it is hopelessly divided, apparently without even the most basic agreement that its differences will be resolved periodically by elections. Mursi made some big mistakes. Perhaps his first was to nominate for president when the Brotherhood promised it would not field a candidate. Once in power, he promised an economic recovery that was never going to happen. He issued, then retracted, a decree that made his executive decisions above the scrutiny of the courts and shoved through a constitution (via a hasty referendum) with an unnecessarily partisan flavour.This immediately alienated those sectors of society not sympathetic to his cause, guaranteeing a political environment of perpetual suspicion and protest. And that's to say nothing of the violence against religious minorities that occurred on his watch.But he should have been allowed to crash at an election. He might then have ended up a symbol of the Brotherhood's political failure. Instead he'll be a symbol of democratic failure, with all that entails. Meanwhile, the depth of Egyptian division means those who called for Mursi's head will eventually start calling for each other's, while its economic disaster (which was hardly Mursi's making) means no new president will be its saviour. If so, we'll be left to ask precisely what has been gained by all this. What will be much clearer, though, is what has been sacrificed.
**********Turkey's secular story is beginning to unravel********June 14, 2013******0**** You know something extraordinary is happening when sworn enemies are locking arms in solidarity. And right now in Turkey, something extraordinary is happening. Ultra-nationalists are uniting with the Kurdish activists whose rights they have so long denied, and together they face the tear-gas and water cannon the police unleash on them.Beside them are seasoned opposition supporters and young urban Turks, children and adolescents, many of them with very shallow histories of political engagement. ''Those who wanted to kill each other last week became - no exaggeration - comrades on the streets,'' wrote Turkish journalist Ece Temelkuran in New Statesman.The most transformational protests are often the product of wildly varied groups who agree on little except what they hate. Indeed, that is very much the story of the Arab uprisings that continue to reverberate across the region.These Turkish protests are not quite of that revolutionary moment. There is no prospect of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan being toppled, and even if he were it would hardly be the collapse of a decades-old dictatorial regime. But these protests are revolutionary in a different way. This might just be the moment that the fault lines of Turkish politics are radically recast.Until now, those fault lines have been abundantly clear. The classic power struggle is between what Turks often call ''White Turks'' and ''Black Turks'': a secular elite, led by the army, who see themselves as the defenders of Ataturk's nationalist legacy, and the more traditional, religiously inclined masses.The racial imagery is deliberate. White Turks are meant to be the equivalent of our own WASPs. They are socially empowered, overwhelmingly urban, wealthier and better educated. They have Western lifestyles, adopt Western modes of dress and drink Western alcohol. They also tend to look down on ''blacks'', whom they regard as unrefined because of their religious commitments and cultural conservatism.The divide is bitter, enduring and never far from the surface. When one professor of international relations was asked this week about the rapidly changing nature of Istanbul as more upwardly mobile Black Turks had taken jobs there, he told The New York Times the city had ''been invaded by Anatolian peasants'', whom he regarded as ''uncultured''.Erdogan has scarcely pretended to be a unifying figure. ''Your brother Tayyip belongs to the Black Turks,'' he famously declared about 15 years ago. Little wonder the military has long wanted to destroy him.In 2008, for instance, it went to the Constitutional Court and asked it to ban Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (or AKP) on the basis that it was ''a focal point of anti-secular activities'' and was ''trying to turn the country into an Islamic state''. The case was lost, but the audacity of it was telling: this was nothing less than an attempt to remove a democratically elected government that only the previous year had won in a landslide.Since 1960, the military has also executed three more traditional coups. In its zeal to preserve Turkey's secular nationalism, the military has long arrogated to itself the power to subvert the democratic will.And that has always been the basis of Erdogan's legitimacy. Whatever the secular elite want to say about him, and whatever threats the military wanted to make, he had the people demonstrably on his side. Erdogan has been winning elections for 10 years, and winning them emphatically. The military had inherited privilege and an ideology to support it, but it had no popular mandate. This only became more important when Turkey's tilt at EU membership required it to enhance its democratic credentials and establish civilian control over the military. That's a Herculean task but Erdogan has carried it off.The high-water mark is surely the successful constitutional referendum held on the highly symbolic date of September 12, 2010 - exactly 30 years after the 1980 military coup. This sent military power into serious retreat because among its suite of reforms it abolished the legal protection enjoyed by coup leaders. Plotting a coup would be a crime against the state, prosecuted in civilian courts. This was perhaps the most significant liberal democratic reform in Turkey's history, and it left the military with nowhere to go.It's a story that confounds Western notions that secularism is always liberal and freedom-enhancing, and religious politics is always on the side of authoritarianism. Here, authoritarianism was secularism's handmaiden.To be liberal and democratic was to vote with the Black Turks. But now that story is starting to unravel. Now Erdogan is the one striking a dictatorial pose.After a period of remarkable improvement - marked by a significant decline in torture and the recognition of the cultural rights of the Kurdish minority - Turkey's human rights record is regressing. Turkey now has more journalists in prison than any other country. Many of them have not been charged. A mandatory internet filtering regime is in place. Opposition politicians and human rights lawyers have been arrested and imprisoned. Now they're gassing protesters.''They are drunk with power,'' says one academic observer of Erdogan's government. ''They lost their democratic reflexes and are returning to what is the essence of Turkish politics: authoritarianism.''And that's what these protests - which began with a sit-in against a planned shopping mall - are really about. The old secular/religious division is falling away. There are not just White Turks and Black Turks any more. Amid the diverse fray we are witnessing the arrival of something Turkish politics has never really seen but desperately needs. Meet the Grey Turks: young, urban, well educated - not necessarily secular, but definitely democratic.
**********When making war is so easy, Obama's doubts about morality of some drone strikes may be irrelevant********May 31, 2013******0**** With great power comes unaccountability. Until now the Western world, under the cover of the world's sole superpower, has scarcely needed to engage with the ethics of using armed drones.Occasionally, a drone strike would make the news. Occasionally, some commentator or other would gnash teeth. Almost always anti-American anger and resentment would grow in the countries where the strike happened. But ultimately, no one can actually do anything about any of this. So, overwhelmingly the Obama administration gave no answers to questions that weren't asked.But all that's changing. US President Barack Obama has just confessed that using drones is not ''wise or moral in every instance'', and that they should be used as a last resort. This is largely a response to growing US discontent about his administration's mysterious drone program. We now know that American drones have killed four of the country's own citizens. So the President is asking Congress to help him develop some kind of oversight for American drone use to ensure they are used only against people who are ''a continuing, imminent threat to Americans'' and cannot be captured.Obama's reckoning with the ethics of drones is welcome. But what if it's too late? What if he's unleashed a mode of warfare he cannot control, and we'll come one day to regret?It seems inevitable that lots of countries will soon enough have drones of their own. Perhaps the most overlooked story of the year comes from China, where the People's Liberation Army hatched a plan to send a drone to Myanmar to assassinate a drug trafficker who had murdered 13 Chinese nationals. As it happens, the Chinese government didn't go ahead with it, but not because it couldn't. In fact, China is developing quite a fleet. And it has plans to share them around.A US drone costs anywhere from $5 million to $10 million. Depending on who you believe, China can build them for less than $1 million. If that's true, you can forget any idea of an American monopoly on the drone market. Now consider China's customers: countries who want cheap weapons, and who'd rather not buy them from America or Israel. Really, anyone in the developing world is a candidate. It's hard to resist the conclusion that we're staring at the future of warfare.Is that a bad thing? To date the arguments for and against drones have focused on civilian casualties. Put briefly, critics claim a high civilian toll from the American program, while its defenders claim drones have greater precision, get into places that soldiers can't and, therefore, limit what is so grotesquely called ''collateral damage''. The focus on civilian deaths is noble, but the argument is futile. The truth - indeed the very problem - is that we're in the dark on this.No one knows how many civilians have been killed. The British-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism puts the number at more than 1000, but there's no way of knowing. The US government hints that the figure is lower, but won't give one of its own, and even if it did it might not mean much.But even if we could get a reliable figure, it's unclear precisely what it would mean. How many civilians would have died if conventional weapons were used instead? How many (if any) of these strikes would not have gone ahead if drones weren't available? Sadly, we're in an era when civilian deaths are deemed an acceptable inevitability of war, rather than a reason to avoid it.Whatever the truth of these claims and counterclaims, perhaps the best objections to drone warfare have nothing to do with pragmatic arguments over counting bodies. The central problem is drones permit a kind of no-risk, low-cost warfare. Indeed, they so radically and fundamentally alter the nature of war that they risk making war seem far less grave, and far easier to wage.War is a kind of contract. Each side confronts the other, with the risk of death and defeat. In short, war should come at a cost. That contract is shredded when you're attacked by something that cannot itself be killed. It's not remotely a fair fight. It's scarcely a fight at all.
**********A red dawn hovers over the West's privilege of cultural supremacy********May 3, 2013******0**** Turns out Robert Downey jnr is a Sinophile. ''I live a very Chinese life in America,'' he recently declared. I don't know what that means, either. But I'm pretty sure it has a lot to do with money. He was speaking at the international promotional launch of Iron Man 3, which took place not in Los Angeles, New York or London, but in Beijing. Behind the gates of the Forbidden City, no less.None of this happened by accident. When  Iron Man 3 hits Chinese cinemas this week, audiences will be seeing a special edit of the film made just for them. It will feature extra sequences shot in China and expanded roles for some Chinese film stars. It will have lucrative product placement from the Chinese tech giant TCL. Indeed, the entire film is a collaboration between Disney and the Chinese production studio DMG Entertainment.The film market reflects the geopolitics of our age. America will not be much longer an unrivalled superpower, and China's rise is unstoppable. ''There's always been a number two,'' DMG chief executive Dan Mintz explained. ''But this is the first time anyone is challenging for number one''. It will win that challenge by 2020. Hence, the quest for the Chinese dollar is on - and it has been ever since James Cameron grossed 222 million of them with Avatar.But that means playing by Chinese rules. In Iron Man 3's case, Chinese government officials were on set to ''monitor filming''. Several other films have shown similar, um, sensitivity. Ugly depictions of the sex trade in the Chinese region of Macau were reportedly dumped from Skyfall, as was a scene in which a Chinese security guard is assassinated. The apocalyptic zombies in World War Z were the result of a Chinese SARS-like virus, until Paramount thought better of it and made the source a Moscow flu, first spotted - of course - by a Chinese scientist. Then there's last year's remake of Red Dawn with an altered plot that has the US invaded not by China, but by North Korea. Or Looper, which depicts a future in which the capital of the world is Beijing, rather than Paris, which was the original plan.I could go on, but the pattern is clear. ''The adjustment of some of our films for different world markets is a commercial reality, and we recognise China's right to determine what content enters their country,'' a spokesman for the Motion Picture Association of America said. That's management-speak for ''we have no choice about this if we want to make money â€¦ and we do''.Clearly not everyone is comfortable about all this. A quick scan of the news coverage of Hollywood's Chinese courtship turns up headlines about ''bowing'' and ''kowtowing'' to Chinese sensibilities. Similarly, when Qantas announced recently that - owing to its new partnership with Emirates - pork would not be available on flights going through Dubai, some Australians threatened to boycott Qantas, condemning it for ''sleeping with the Islamic enemy'' and saying ''[our] religion has been disrespected by the removal of pork products'' - because apparently eating pork is now some kind of sacrament. Meanwhile Qantas' ticket sales to Europe have increased 500 per cent.Welcome to the Asian century. It begins with commerce, but it must inevitably encompass so much more than that. We talk often about how economic power brings with it political and military power. Less frequently do we recognise it brings cultural power, too. So if the age of Western economic domination is coming slowly to an end, so too is the age of Western cultural domination. Hollywood's Chinese dalliance, or Qantas' new menu, are merely the seedlings of this inevitable change.It has never been entirely true that globalisation is something only the West does to the East. But it is true that its impacts are not evenly felt. Some Eastern phenomena do travel West - Bollywood and Gangnam Style being perhaps the cheesiest examples - but for sheer cultural hegemony, nothing really competes with the West. It is a rare country that escaped all Americanisation of its culture during the 20th century.But the worm of globalisation is turning. Those screeching at pork-free Qantas flights have probably never given any thought to the fact that almost every Middle Eastern airline - including Emirates - serves alcohol, subordinating the region's own cultural and religious norms to the desires of paying customers. I doubt we'd ever call that ''kowtowing''.Very few of us will have wondered what it must be like for the developed world to face a steady bombardment of Western sitcoms, action flicks and romantic comedies that, at least until now, were made without a second thought for their compatibility with the cultural values of those societies.What must it mean to an Asian musician to know that the only path to global stardom is through Western music alone, and that even then the chances are far slimmer than for their American counterparts? We've probably never considered what impact it must have on dark-skinned women around the world to see the fashion centres of Europe producing globally famous white supermodels, which must surely reinforce notions of beauty they can never attain without buying some whitening cream or other product. (Which they do. A lot.)
**********Terrorism: how we manage it differently now********April 19, 2013******0**** Let's clear something up. Our responses to terrorism are not about the loss of innocent life. We think they are because that's the first thing we talk about. We use the suffering of victims to emote, and we look at the attacks through that prism. But it's never really about the victims. It's about us.It's about the magnetic trauma of watching these attacks repeat on our news services. It's about the fact that each of us is entirely interchangeable with the killed and injured; that we can so easily transpose ourselves into the situation. It's about the brutal unpredictability of the violence.This is partly why this week's Boston Marathon bombings have attracted so much more of our attention than the much deadlier Iraq bombings on the same day. It's not just that we don't value Iraqi lives as much as US ones (although this is undoubtedly true given our ability to rationalise away the mammoth loss of civilian life in the Iraq war). It's that there is nothing truly surprising about them. They do not shock us. And thus, they cannot truly terrorise us.Terrorism is a grotesque form of theatre. It doesn't exist without its audience, which is why it's always public. The show is for us. The most futile terrorist attack is the one we fail to notice. So, it is designed to seize our emotions; to make us incapable of ignoring it. This is terrorism's paradox: it succeeds only because we make it. We ultimately decide whether it is effective. And generally we react wildly, rewarding the terrorists who have sought to provoke us.But something is different this time. President Barack Obama's initial response was to tell us all the things we didn't know. ''We don't yet have all the answers,'' he began. ''We still do not know who did this, or why. And people should not jump to conclusions before we have all the facts.'' His tone was cool and authoritative - described by Time as ''efficient formality'' - as though he was determined to avoid any emotional response. Only the next day did he describe the blasts as ''an act of terror''.Closer to home, Foreign Affairs Minister Bob Carr responded by telling Australians considering travel to the US ''I wouldn't alter my travel arrangements. This is something that, the way we live now, could occur at any time. In fact, if you look at the experience of terrorism since September 11, 2001 â€¦ what is striking is how little progress in over a decade the terrorists have made.''Meanwhile, NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell rejected suggestions of a suffocating security crackdown on the City to Surf, since that would mean it was ''not of the same character'' and ''would actually give a win to those people who engage in those sorts of acts of violence''.This is a far cry from the kind of hysteria that typically follows a terrorist attack. There's no talk of smoking anyone out of their holes, or bombing anyone back to the Stone Age. There's no with-us-or-against us ultimatum. Sure, this attack isn't as apocalyptic as September 11. But it is just about impossible to imagine that if the Boston Marathon had been bombed 12 years ago, the response would have been so restrained. It's almost as if we're dealing with an unfortunate matter of routine.Even the media coverage has, generally, followed suit. Yes, the New York Post got it about as wrong as possible when it declared 12 people had died, and that a Saudi national had been identified as a suspect. But then, the Post has long since given up on being a real newspaper. More reputable organisations such as CNN and the Associated Press committed one howler, reporting a suspect had been arrested when that wasn't true and prompting a swift, terse rebuke from authorities.But this was no Oslo debacle, when every outlet from The New York Times to the BBC proceeded cheerfully on the basis that the terrorists were connected somehow with al-Qaeda. We're witnessing something truly remarkable: media outlets almost sticking to reporting what they know, and not racing ahead of a terrorism story. Ever since the bombs detonated, we've confronted something of a deafening silence; a huge vacuum in the story. Why are so few attempting to fill it?I have two theories on this. The most encouraging one is that we're finally maturing in the way we handle terrorism. Gone is the triumphalist rhetoric of the ''War on Terror'', with its ridiculous promises of a terrorism-free world and the ultimate victory of freedom over tyranny. In its place is a far more sober, pragmatic recognition that terrorism is a perpetual irritant, and that while it is tragic and emotionally lacerating, it kills relatively few people and is not any kind of existential threat.Perhaps we're learning to avoid being sucked into terrorism's radicalising vortex, where attack brings overreaction, and the violence rapidly escalates. And perhaps the media have been so stung by the embarrassment of Oslo that they have recognised the virtue in shutting up occasionally.But it's possible, too, that this reticence is a product of the very real suspicion that the perpetrators here are self-styled American patriots. At this point, most analysts are leaning that way. And while it's entirely possible they are wrong, there's something chilling about realising this violence might not be something that can be assigned to a demonic other. Maybe we're speaking in more hushed tones because our own societies might just be implicated.We won't know until perpetrators come to light. Does the act suddenly become more heinous if it's Islamist? Does terrorism cease to be a fact of life, and once more become an existential threat? If so, that can't be about the attack itself, which after all is the same either way. It must be about the politics, and the prejudices, we bring to it. That could be extremely revealing.

**********Bomb response refreshingly honest********April 19, 2013******0**** Let's clear something up: our responses to terrorism are not about the loss of innocent life. We think they are because that's the first thing we talk about. We use the suffering of victims to emote, and we look at the attacks through that prism. But it's never really about the victims. It's about us. It's about the magnetic trauma of watching these attacks repeat on our news services. It's about the fact each of us is entirely interchangeable with the killed and injured; that we can so easily transpose ourselves into the situation. It's about the brutal unpredictability of the violence.This is partly why the Boston Marathon bombings have attracted so much more of our attention than the much deadlier bombings that struck Iraq on the same day. It's not just that we don't value Iraqi lives as much as American ones (although this is true, given our ability to rationalise away the mammoth loss of civilian life during the Iraq war). It's that there is nothing surprising about them. They do not shock us. And for that reason, they cannot truly terrorise us.Terrorism is a grotesque form of theatre. It doesn't exist without its audience, which is why it is always public. The show is for us. The most futile terrorist attack is the one we fail to notice. So it is designed to seize our emotions; to make us incapable of ignoring it. Thus is terrorism's paradox: it succeeds only because we make it. We ultimately decide whether or not it is effective. And generally we react wildly, thereby rewarding the terrorists who have sought to provoke us.But it is different this time. US President Barack Obama's initial response was to tell us all the things we did not know. ''We don't yet have all the answers,'' he began. ''We still do not know who did this, or why. And people should not jump to conclusions before we have all the facts.'' His tone was cool and authoritative - described by Time as ''efficient formality'' - as if he was determined to avoid any emotional response. Only the next day did he describe it as ''an act of terror''.Closer to home, Foreign Affairs Minister Bob Carr responded by telling Australians considering travel to the US: ''I wouldn't alter my travel arrangements. This is something that, the way we live now, could occur at any time. In fact, if you look at the experience of terrorism since September 11, 2001 â€¦ what is striking is how little progress in over a decade the terrorists have made.''Meanwhile, NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell rejected any suggestion of a suffocating security crackdown on the City2Surf, since that would mean it was ''not of the same character'' and ''would actually give a win to those people who engage in those sorts of acts of violence''.This is a far cry from the kind of hysteria that typically follows a terrorist attack. There's no talk of smoking anyone out of their holes, or bombing anyone back to the Stone Age. There's no with-us-or-against-us ultimatum. Sure, this attack isn't as apocalyptic as September 11. But it is just about impossible to imagine that if the Boston Marathon had been bombed 12 years ago, the response would have been so restrained. It's almost as if we're dealing with an unfortunate matter of routine.Even the media coverage has, generally, followed suit. Yes, the New York Post got it about as wrong as possible when it declared 12 people had died, and a Saudi national had been identified as a suspect. But then, the Post has long since given up on being a real newspaper.More reputable organisations such as CNN and the Associated Press committed one howler, reporting a suspect had been arrested when that was not true - prompting a swift, terse rebuke from authorities. But this was no Oslo debacle, when every outlet from The New York Times to the BBC proceeded cheerfully on the basis that the terrorists were connected somehow with al-Qaeda. We're witnessing something truly remarkable: media outlets almost sticking to reporting what they know, and not racing ahead of a terrorism story. Ever since the bombs detonated, we've confronted something of a deafening silence, a huge vacuum in the story. Why are so few attempting to fill it?I have two theories on this. The most encouraging one is that we're finally maturing in the way we handle terrorism. Gone is the triumphalist rhetoric of the ''War on Terror'', with its ridiculous promises of a terrorism-free world and the ultimate victory of freedom over tyranny. In its place is a far more sober, pragmatic recognition that terrorism is a perpetual irritant, and that while it is tragic and emotionally lacerating, it kills relatively few people and is not any kind of existential threat. Perhaps we're learning to avoid being sucked into terrorism's radicalising vortex, where attack brings overreaction, and the violence rapidly escalates. And perhaps the media have been so stung by the embarrassment of Oslo that they have recognised the virtue in shutting up occasionally.But it's possible, too, that this reticence is a product of the very real suspicion that the perpetrators here are self-styled American patriots. At this point, most analysts are leaning that way. And while it's entirely possible they are wrong, there's something chilling about realising that this violence might not be something that can be assigned to a demonic other. Maybe we're speaking in more hushed tones because our own societies might just be implicated.We won't know until perpetrators come to light. Does the act become more heinous if it is Islamist? Does terrorism cease to be a fact of life, and once more become an existential threat? If so, it cannot be about the attack itself, which, after all, is the same either way. It must be about the politics, the prejudices, we bring to it. That could be very revealing. Watch this space.
**********Curse of Australia's silent pervasive racism********April 5, 2013******0**** As opening lines in letters go, ''I find you deeply offensive'' is pretty direct. Fair enough. I suspect lots of people do. It's a natural consequence of media work. But then my anonymous correspondent decided to explain why: ''You are foreign, you shall always be so. Piss off back to whatever Middle Eastern sink hole you blew in here from.''There's nothing surprising about this. There's nothing even particularly rare about it. Some version of that letter arrives every few months or so. This one was particularly unvarnished - complete with references to my wife and ''half caste kids'' and cheerful threats of the inevitable return of the White Australia policy - but the message hardly varies: this isn't my country and my public presence is unwelcome, either because I'm a Muslim, or because in some racially determinable way not a ''real'' Australian.I've been accused of everything from taking elocution lessons, to changing the spelling of my name to appear deceptively Australian before I unleash some Trojan conspiracy. Apparently Aly is roughly equivalent to Smith. They're onto me.I have almost no emotional reaction to this kind of goonish racism. It's simply too ridiculous to engage me. In fact, I'd completely forgotten about this most recent letter until racist ranting hit the headlines this week following yet another racist diatribe on a Sydney bus that was captured and posted to YouTube.It's at least the third such case in about four months. Hence the fresh round of debate on Australian racism that always seems to follow the same unedifying pattern.First comes the shock, as though such incidents reveal something we never knew existed. Then comes the argument over whether or not Australia is a racist country. To be frank, I don't know what the argument means. Every country has racism. Precisely how much do you need before a country itself is racist? Is it a matter of essence or degree? Do we judge it by surveying legislation, newspapers or behaviour on public transport? And even if we can answer those questions, then what?That argument is a dead end. It's more about a condemnatory label than the substance and nature of Australian racism. The real question isn't about which adjective describes us. It's about how best to identify and respond to the racism we inevitably harbour.Debating the meaning of the occasional racist tirade doesn't help answer that. It's just not that helpful to take extreme individual behaviour as the starting point on an issue like this. Sure, it's troubling. Sure, it's more common than we like to admit. Sure, it's a problem. But it's not the problem.The racism that really matters in Australia isn't the high-level, weapons-grade derangement that winds its way via YouTube into the news. The truth is we can't compete with Europe for hardcore white nationalism or the US for white supremacist movements. We can't compete with Asia or the Middle East for the maintenance of an explicit, institutionalised and sometimes codified racial hierarchy.Our racial and religious minorities aren't having their communities torched (though the occasional building has been firebombed), and our handful of far-right politicians aren't leading political parties that attract 20 per cent of the vote.No, our real problem is the subterranean racism that goes largely unremarked upon and that we seem unable even to detect. Like the racism revealed by an Australian National University study, which found you're significantly less likely to get a job interview if you have a non-European name. The researchers sent fake CVs in response to job advertisements, changing only the name of the applicant. It turns out that if you're surname is Chinese, you have to apply for 68 per cent more jobs to get the same number of interviews as a Anglo-Australian. If you're Middle Eastern, it's 64 per cent. If you're indigenous, 35 per cent.This is the polite racism of the educated middle class. It's not as shocking as the viral racist tirades we've seen lately. No doubt the HR managers behind these statistics would be genuinely appalled by such acts of brazen, overt racism. Indeed, they probably enforce racial discrimination rules in their workplace and are proud to do so. Nonetheless, theirs is surely a more devastating, enduring racism. There's no event to film, just the daily, invisible operation of a silent, pervasive prejudice. It doesn't get called out.It's just the way things are; a structure of society.That's what bothers me about all the fuss that surrounds these occasional racist diatribes. It puts the focus overwhelmingly on the most exceptional kinds of racist behaviour. But are we capable of recognising racism when it isn't gobsmackingly obvious? Recall, for example, the widespread failure to understand why former Telstra boss Sol Trujillo felt racially offended to being caricatured relentlessly in the press as a sleepy, sombrero-wearing Mexican on a donkey, or described as a ''Mexican bandit''. Certainly, criticise his management of Telstra, but can we really not see the gratuitous racial stereotyping? And Trujillo isn't even Mexican.Or note the strange Australian comfort with adopting blackface. Remember when Qantas gave two Wallabies fans free tickets because they promised to dress as Radike Samo by blacking up and donning Afro wigs? No offence intended. Qantas apologised.But that's the thing about racism: it goes way beyond bad intentions. The most insidious racism is just so ingrained it's involuntary. It's not about what Qantas intended. It's about the fact no one responsible for the decision even saw the existence of the problem. That sort of thing worries me much more than some crude, anonymous hate mail.It's easy to point at the barking racists on the bus precisely because they aren't us. They allow us to exonerate ourselves; to declare that if we have a problem with racism, at least people like us aren't responsible for it. It allows us to escape self-examination of the racism we all probably harbour to some extent or other.That self-examination is crucial. Without it we have nothing to fix, and only other people to blame.
**********Abbott's adoptive strategy on policy********September 6, 2013******0**** It started with pious calls for "consensus politics". Remember them? How Bob Katter enthused about a "new paradigm"? Julia Gillard called for a "new politics", which I can only assume was roughly equivalent to Tony Abbott's "kinder, gentler polity". Then followed the most bitter, cantankerous Parliament in generations, in which every mere breath would be contested.Now, after all that exhausting, dispiriting muck, the end result has been a quite astonishing consensus. At the 11th hour, and almost without anyone noticing, the biggest disagreements of the past three years (the carbon tax aside) have been dissolved. Perhaps most astonishingly, several of them have been resolved in favour of the Labor government we now look set to eject.On Saturday the country will elect a party with an expensive national broadband network policy. It will vote for a party that will significantly increase education funding, at least for four years. It will elect a party that has resolved that the best way to handle asylum seekers arriving by boat is just to kick them out so some other country has to deal with them. Sure, differences remain between the parties on these issues. Some of these differences even matter; there are still fights to be had. But they are now over matters of detail rather than essence. You know something is happening when Tony Abbott is explicitly spruiking a "unity ticket" with Kevin Rudd on education funding (even though he fails to match Labor for the most expensive years of the Gonski plan).All this is a long way from the days when the national broadband network was a "white elephant", and a "colossal waste of taxpayers' money" that the Coalition had solemnly pledged to "dismantle". Now, as Alan Kohler observed when the Coalition finally proposed an alternative national broadband network of its own, "Malcolm Turnbull's great achievement over the past 2Â½ years has been to save the national broadband network". It's a long way, too, from Christopher Pyne's dismissal of Gonski as "a Conski"; from his insistence that "the status quo is a better model" of education funding before unabashedly declaring "Labor should have been doing this last year" and deciding to "adopt exactly the same funding envelope as Labor".But the grandest, most damascene conversion has come on fiscal policy. For years the Coalition has held Labor at gunpoint, demanding a return to surplus as some kind of litmus test for good government. For years, and for reasons unfathomable, Labor has played along. Having taken the perfectly defensible Keynesian path of running a deficit to stimulate the economy during a global recession, it became so obsessed with proving its deficit was temporary that it simply forgot to argue its case.The entire economic conversation revolved around a promised return to surplus by 2012-13. Nothing could divert Labor from this course. Not even a gigantic natural disaster such as the Queensland floods in 2011. If ever there was a reason - or even an excuse - to shelve the surplus and build the nation, this was it. Instead, Labor introduced a levy, pledged to cut spending, and held fast to a promise no economist seemed to think was a good idea, and which it was never going to be able to keep. The scene was bizarre. In its zealous search for a surplus, Labor kept trying to find cuts to government spending. This, of course, deflates the economy. So the Reserve Bank was frantically cutting interest rates in an attempt to stimulate. Here we had two institutions beavering away at cancelling each other out.Even when it became clear last year that both company profits and wages were falling - effectively destroying the government's tax revenue - Labor still insisted it could cut its way to surplus. By Christmas it had to concede. The surplus, once a holy grail and unexplained economic necessity, became an irresponsible goal that would compromise "jobs and growth". And thus ended one of Labor's most foolhardy, damaging attempts to appease the Coalition.Only now, the Coalition has converted, too. The most underrated phrase of this entire campaign was Joe Hockey's plan for "appropriate stimulus", even if that meant we'd have to forget about the surplus for a while. This is the same Coalition that seemed so resolutely not to believe in stimulus, that it argued against it even during the financial crisis. Well, forget that. We're all Keynesians now.Rudd can argue all he likes that Abbott will cut the economy to shreds and plunge it into recession, but he has two problems. First, this contradicts everything Labor was telling us for years when it insisted it would find whatever cuts were necessary to deliver that surplus. Second, Abbott has freed himself from the shackles of finding a surplus, thus allowing him to shelve spending cuts until there's no danger of a recession. He has manoeuvred this beautifully - exactly as Labor should have done from the start.All this is a testament to the brutal efficiency of Abbott's opposition. He's quite prepared to bludgeon the government with an argument he later rejects. It's shameless, but it works because he does it with confidence and a straight face.Contrast Labor, which has spent far too much time answering the Coalition's charges rather than telling its own story, in its own political terms. If it falls on Saturday, it will certainly leave a legacy: disability insurance, broadband, Gonski. But we won't really know what that legacy means because it has never really told us. Besides, these are Coalition policies now, too. In so many ways, Labor has won the arguments it refused to have, and for which it will receive no reward.
