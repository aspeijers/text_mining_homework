**********NSW bill is about marriage, just not equality********November 1, 2013******193**** Amid all the pyrotechnics surrounding same-sex marriage this week, it's important to remember that this is overwhelmingly a symbolic debate. That doesn't mean it's unimportant. Symbolism matters to us in a visceral way, sometimes even more than substance. That is why flag-burning is such a provocative act. But it's important to know when something is symbolic so we can assess what has or hasn't been achieved.It's true there are real, substantive issues of discrimination at play. Same-sex couples don't have the same rights and entitlements as married heterosexual ones do on a range of things: workers' compensation death benefits, pensions for the partners of Defence Force veterans, access to carer's leave for example. It's true same-sex marriage would quickly remedy this. But it's also true that you could remove that discrimination by amending the way those entitlements work without even thinking about same-sex marriage. And if you did that, marriage equality activists would still want to change the definition of marriage, and their opponents would still resist them. In fact, their opponents would probably be happy to give same-sex couples all those rights if they'd just leave marriage alone.That's why the ACT government found itself in court this week, defending its marriage equality legislation from the federal government's legal attack, why a same-sex marriage bill was debated in NSW Parliament on Thursday (though Premier Barry O'Farrell has indicated he will not support a state same-sex marriage bill, only a federal one), and why the Tasmanian upper house ultimately decided not to proceed with similar legislation of its own. None of these laws, which could operate only at state and territory levels, remedy same-sex discrimination in a stroke. They are political acts designed to make symbolic, political statements.This is clearest in the case of the ACT legislation which, one way or another, is doomed to failure. Even if it wins in the High Court, the federal government can - and almost certainly will - override the legislation because it has the power to do that to a territory. The ACT will have opened the way for states, but territorians must surely know that every marriage they contract under this legislation will one day be annulled. The ACT government surely knows this, too. It isn't looking for a substantive result; it's trying to apply pressure to the federal government.But something strange has arisen this week in the attempt to do that. So strong is the sense that marriage equality's moment is approaching, and so frenzied is the race to get there, that marriage equality advocates have begun, in a remarkable way, to argue against their own position.The ACT's present fight with the federal government comes down to whether or not the Federal Marriage Act is intended to be a comprehensive statement on the definition of marriage, which precludes the states having anything to say on the matter. If so, the laws are inconsistent and the federal law prevails. This is for the High Court to decide, and while the ACT certainly has a chance of winning, there's no doubt it's vulnerable. At least, that is the view of Bret Walker, SC, one of the country's best constitutional lawyers, who has been advising Australian Marriage Equality. But, he says, the NSW bill and its (now defunct) Tasmanian counterpart are on stronger ground.The key difference is that those bills don't attempt to redefine marriage. In fact, they avoid legislating on marriage at all. Instead they create a new species of legal relationship that happens to be called ''same-sex marriage''. Since this is not the same thing as ''marriage'' in the meaning of federal law, it can't be treading on federal toes.It's a neat legal technique. It's a strong legal argument. The only problem for marriage equality activists is that it completely undermines the cause. This is not simply a small matter of language. It's about changing the whole concept of the legislation.The very purpose of marriage equality is to extend the definition of marriage so it is blind to gender. That's what the ACT bill is attempting to do. And that's exactly what you don't do by sidestepping this process and creating an entirely new social construct that just happens to have ''marriage'' in its name. A ''same-sex marriage'' is just a civil union by a more political name.Really, you can call it what you like - a ''consolation marriage'' might be most honest - you've done nothing to change the legal definition of marriage. A legally rigorous man still couldn't turn to his boyfriend and ask: ''Will you marry me?'' It would have to be: ''Will you same-sex marry me?'' In that way, the NSW bill might offer same-sex marriage, but it's not offering marriage equality. It's a bit like republicans finally replacing the monarch with a system of hereditary, foreign-born presidents.As symbolic achievements go, that would be relatively anaemic. But now you have marriage equality activists, who are typically uninspired by the prospect of civil unions, pleading with the ACT government to enact precisely that, and reacting angrily when it refuses to do so.Take independent NSW MP Alex Greenwich's warning that ''it is not going to be Tony Abbott, it is not going to be the High Court that will be blamed for the invalidation of these marriages, it will be the ACT government that will be blamed''. Perhaps. But the ACT's response would surely be that at least they had marriages to annul.Meanwhile, opponents of marriage equality, who frequently offer civil unions as some kind of compromise, seem not to have seen the opportunity. They're delighting in their victory in Tasmania, but the onward march of same-sex marriage - which transcends traditional partisan or conservative/progressive lines - suggests that victory can only be pyrrhic.Perhaps their best strategy would be to limit same-sex marriage to consolation, state-level status, especially if their opponents seem happy with that. One look at the NSW and Tasmanian bills and they should be should be leaping on them, screaming: ''Deal! Are we done now?''
**********Allah edict masks power play********October 18, 2013******38**** Six years ago, Proton - Malaysia's national car maker - teamed up with car makers in Iran and Turkey pledging to develop the world's first ''Islamic car''. Apparently automobiles had hitherto been non-Muslims. If that's not absurd enough, this week we learnt it's a good thing Malaysian cars can't talk, because if they could, they'd no longer be able to use the word ''Allah'' to mean ''God''. That's what a Malaysian appeal court ruled this week, after a Catholic, Malay-language newspaper had dared to drop the A-bomb.The ''Allah'' controversy has been running for years and isn't over yet. This decision overturned the original finding from 2009 in favour of the newspaper. Now the editor is planning to appeal to the highest court in the country and the government will resist. This immediately reminded me of Proton's Islamic car: strip both these stories of the pious language that decorates them, and they're ultimately about the maintenance of Malay pride. These are symbolic gestures of ethno-nationalism. And that whole issue is becoming increasingly radioactive in Malaysian politics and society.To see this, consider what precisely makes the Islamic car so ''Islamic'': compartments for storing a headscarf and Koran, and a compass to indicate the direction of Mecca. That's it. As though no car in history has sported a compass or storage. If you're in any doubt about how thin this Islamic veneer is, consider that Proton was considering a ''secular'' version for non-Muslim markets. This is not about function. It's not meeting a consumer need. This is appealing to consumer identity. It's selling a feeling of authenticity. Don't just be a Muslim, be very Muslim. The content of that commitment matters far less than the statement it makes.The ''Allah'' imbroglio is altogether more serious, but no less strange. Arab Christians, Jews and pagans were using the word before Islam came along. The word has always appeared in Arabic translations of the Bible without controversy. The same ultimately came to be true in the Malay language, which incorporates plenty of Arabic lexicon. So it's hardly surprising that Malaysian Christians have been using the word, too. For longer than Malaysia has existed, as it happens. It's in their Bibles, too.Why should this suddenly be a problem? The Malaysian court held that Allah ''is not an integral part of the faith in Christianity'' and that therefore its use in a Catholic newspaper ''will cause confusion in the community''. The fear, apparently, is that Muslims will suddenly start practising Christianity if both faith groups refer to God by the same name. Malaysian Muslims therefore need a form of protection from their own ignorance that no Muslim community has needed anywhere at any time.But this isn't about that. If it were, you'd expect Malaysia's Islamist opposition party (PAS) to be at the forefront of this charge. But it is not. Indeed, it is mildly opposed. This is instead about an old guard of Malays (who are officially always Muslims) confronting the fact that the privileged position they've held for the first 50 years of Malaysian independence simply can't hold for the next 50.Now they're lashing out, as if trying to resist the death throes of their own supremacy.That supremacy is a matter of law. Indeed, it's in the constitution, which establishes Malay quotas for entry into civil service, public education and access to federal business licences. The idea was partly that Malays - who were vastly economically disadvantaged - would gain ground on the far wealthier Chinese. When the British drafted this law, the intention was that it would be temporary. Turns out it wasn't, and race has been a constant inflammation point in Malaysian politics ever since, as several race riots demonstrate.The ruling party, UMNO, is a great defender of this privilege. For decades it has served them well. But that edifice crumbled in 2008, when it lost an astonishing 58 seats and barely carried the popular vote. This year it lost even that, and clings to power only thanks to a brazen gerrymander.Its only solution seems to be to divide and conquer: to sell the image of a Malaysia where Malay supremacy is threatened by insurrectionist minorities - and, indeed, where its own power is falling victim to a ''Chinese tsunami''. Its newspapers boomed headlines such as ''What else do the Chinese want?'' and ''Chinese voters are two-faced''. Little wonder, then, the government's non-Malay vote is now almost non-existent.But it's the diving Malay vote that is most interesting. Young, educated, urban Malays in particular are deserting this brand of politics in droves. They're becoming increasingly sceptical of their own privileged status. For all the affirmative action, they remain behind economically. Special access to government contracts has simply meant that Malays with good (often familial) government connections get rich, while the majority watch on from their scarcely adequate dwellings. What began as empowerment ended in corruption.I don't know what became of the Islamic car. I've found barely a trace of it since it was announced. Maybe it was never made, because a new conception of Malaysia was made instead, a step removed from the identity politics of the colonial era, full of upwardly mobile people unlikely to be swayed by a Mecca-oriented compass. That's the problem with being a car maker: you have to accept social evolution at some point. You can't really gerrymander your way to a profit.
**********Republicans stuck in reality they created********October 4, 2013******73**** Contrary to obvious appearances, the Republicans in Congress who this week forced the US government into a coma are not insane. That doesn't mean this wasn't an insane result. It was, on almost every level. That includes the level of pure politics, with polling showing predictably that Americans see no need for this mess, and even Republicans acknowledging the electorate will blame them, not President Barack Obama.They know this because that's what happened the last time they tried this in 1995, handing a struggling Bill Clinton a political gift he took to a landslide victory in 1996. The Republicans are not merely holding a gun to the nation's head, they're holding one to their own.But that doesn't make individual Republicans ''lemmings with suicide vests'', as one of their own colleagues described them. It's not that simple. As individuals, Republican politicians are embracing this insanity for perfectly sane reasons. And that's the problem: the political system is now such that Republicans keep their jobs by making the party increasingly unelectable.This week's farce has its roots in 2010 when Republicans swept their way to majorities in both houses of Congress. It was a stunning return from exile, after Democrats had banished them from every limb of the government in 2008. But then Republicans tried to entrench their position through a colossal gerrymander. Several Republican-controlled states proceeded to redraw their electoral boundaries to make Democrat success nigh on impossible. And it worked.By 2012, results in the House of Representatives were so skewed that the Republicans comfortably maintained their majority despite the fact that Democrat candidates received more than 1 million more votes. Take Pennsylvania, where Democrats won nearly 51 per cent of the vote, but Republicans won 13 seats to five. Or Michigan, where the Democrat vote was nearly 53 per cent while Republicans took almost twice as many seats. North Carolina: 51-49 to the Democrats but nine Republican seats to four. And on it goes. That sort of result landed in at least 10 states - only one of which was rigged to favour the Democrats. To get a sense of the scale of it, consider that in the seven states redrawn by Republicans, near parity voting (16.7 million votes to 16.4 million) delivered 73 Republicans and 34 Democrats.That's a clear perversion of democracy, and it's no accident. The Republican State Leadership Committee made it explicit. It ran a $30 million project called Redmap, aimed at winning key seats at the state level which would give it the power to draw electoral boundaries. What's more, it planned to do this in a census year so it could draw with precision - 2010 was exactly such a year.So the plan worked. The Republicans played the system. But now the system is playing them. Sure, Republicans look set to control the house well into the future. But in the American system, the political contest doesn't simply vanish. It shifts to the primaries. Now if you're a Republican house member, your greatest threat comes not from Democrats, but from other Republican challengers hungry for your seat. The result is that Republicans are talking more to their own base, and less to everyone else.Old school Republicans might shake their heads at the rising rabidity of their Tea Party colleagues, but the truth is they're presently no match for them. The last thing an aspiring congressional Republican needs is a well-funded lobby group running campaigns lacerating them as closet socialists prepared to deal with a rampantly socialist Obama. Freed from the need to defeat any meaningful Democrat challenge, Republican politics is now such that everyone's racing to outbid each other for the mantle of true believer.It's a classic case of a closed system encouraging ever more radical posturing.It doesn't get much more radical than trying to bring the government down. And that's the real concern here: what if this isn't really about Obamacare at all? What if the government shutdown itself is the goal? Truth be told, Republican candidates have been talking about doing this since 2010. Then it wasn't necessarily about Obamacare.It was just as likely about budget cuts - "a down payment on fiscal sanity" in that well-worn Republican phrase sometimes shouted before rallying crowds chanting "cut it or shut it". Either way the subtext has always been the same: that shutting down the government would be a good thing rather than the kind of dysfunction that, say, in a country like ours happens once in a hundred years and causes a government to be dismissed.America's problem is even more serious than it appears. America is now two artificially created countries, operating in parallel. There's the country that chooses presidents, and the one that can only rail righteously against them. The country where funding the government is a matter of sensible routine, and the country where shutting down the government is a badge of pride, a slogan you can sell. The Republican Party is going to have to figure out which country it wants to rule because these countries cannot be reconciled.They won't be until every state hands over the power to draw electoral boundaries to an independent, non-political body. In the meantime, the Republican Party is trapped in a bubble largely of its own making.
**********Abbott sexism gibes miss the point********September 20, 2013******174**** When acting Opposition Leader Chris Bowen quipped this week that there were now more women in Afghanistan's cabinet than Australia's, he must have known the line would stick. In fact it seems to have inspired an entire genre of commentary. Witness Steph Harmon's viral post on Junkee listing "Things That Have More Women In Them Than Tony Abbott's Cabinet": Zoo Weekly's staff meeting; the Saudi Arabia Olympic team; the Iranian cabinet; Tony Abbott's immediate family. And on it goes. One bright spark on Twitter pointed out that Julia Gillard's first cabinet had more prime ministers than Abbott's has women.It's funny. It's sharp. It's a point amusingly and efficiently made. That is, until you stop and think about it. Beyond the clear rhetorical effect, what actually is the point? That this cabinet is embarrassingly male? Sure. But then what? What precise conclusion about this is being urged upon us?I suspect the conclusion is all about Tony Abbott. This, you sense, is the anti-Abbott sector's smoking gun, the evidence that proves his sexism once and for all. "He simply cannot accept women as equals and can only relate to them … as wives, mothers and daughters," declares Tim Dunlop on The Drum, neatly capturing this approach.I very much doubt Bowen is suggesting women's interests are less represented in Australia than in Afghanistan. But I have little doubt he's prodding us to wonder whether Abbott would change that if he had his way. The point is to present Abbott as the ultimate regressive: the misogynist homophobe from yesteryear trying desperately to drag us back to some darker age. That's why Labor is so keen to point out Abbott's is the first cabinet without a dedicated science minister since 1931.This brand of argument is pointless for at least two reasons. First, it has been thoroughly agitated by Abbott's foes for years now. A couple of weeks ago the nation either rejected it as untrue or deemed it an irrelevance. That Abbott has kept his male-dominated shadow cabinet largely in place - pretty much as he said he would - is unlikely to cause Australians to revise their judgment wildly.But second (and most importantly) it misses the point. This isn't about Tony Abbott. It's much bigger than that. It's not even just about gender. There's a broader philosophy at work here that calls into question our society's ability to deal with disadvantage of just about any kind."I never want to see affirmative action," affirmed Bronwyn Bishop in defence of Abbott's cabinet choices. She recounted her struggle to become a NSW senator when no woman had done so previously. "They didn't choose me then but I didn't go away and whinge about it either. I just worked hard so they chose me subsequently."It's a neat, if austere theory of success that comes very much from the Liberal Party's philosophical heart. Hard work is rewarded. Success is in the hands of the individual. This is why Bronwyn Bishop maintains Julia Gillard's misogyny speech was "disgraceful" because it "was playing the victim". This view of society doesn't see victims - at least not on the basis of, say, gender, race or class. It sees individuals who bear the responsibility of their own plight.This is the downside of liberalism, where society is boiled down to individuals and the choices they make. This promises equality of a sort, because it prevents, say, an individual from a despised minority from having to conform to the majority's prejudice. But this also means society's most powerful people are freed from the claims of its least powerful. So women might be free to break the bonds of their traditional gender roles, but if they find they're excluded from the most senior positions by an informal boys' club, then liberalism will probably have little to offer them. After all, these boys are free to associate informally, and barring the most overt discrimination, are free to work with whomever they fancy. Liberalism might save you from formalised slavery, but it will hardly storm the barricades of inherited privilege. In fact, it hardly notices them.This is a quandary facing any liberation movement in a liberal society, of which feminism is only the most newsy example of the moment. Part of the agenda is always to maximise choice, which is why freedom of choice is probably our society's most definitive value. Liberalism has been a useful tool for claiming rights. But the logic on which that rests ultimately keeps glass ceilings in place. Choice is the opposite of coercion, and only coercion is likely to shatter the glass.It's not hard to find senior businessmen who will extol the virtues of more women in senior business roles, for instance. Some can even point to the obstacles to this utopia - such as the absence of suitable childcare arrangements. But ask them to pay more tax to fund those arrangements and they'll laugh at you. Ask them to take on a quota and they might even fume. After all, it compromises their freedom of choice. But if we make these choices from vastly unequal positions, then on balance the interests of the powerful are likely to prevail, and the status quo proceed mostly undisturbed. That's not a matter of a sexist individual here and there. It's a matter of structural disadvantage.That's why so few women are on our top corporate boards, despite mountains of research showing companies with diverse boards will do better. It's why the faces on our televisions - or indeed in our Parliament - remain overwhelmingly white even as our society has become hypercoloured. And it's why, for all the lamenting of the absence of women in Abbott's cabinet, that cabinet is still able to make history by appointing Julie Bishop Australia's first female foreign affairs minister.Clearly, that history is easy to make. It will remain that way as long as we have no language to use other than one of choice and freedom; as long as our politics becomes about individual leaders and the choices they make rather than the broader questions of the way our society works. So many of those presently railing at Abbott would probably proudly describe themselves as small-l liberals. But would they understand the limits of what they're saying?

**********The whole point of detention for asylum seekers is horror, whether it is acknowledged or not********February 21, 2014******311**** Sorry, but we don't get to be outraged at this. The fact that a person is dead, that another has been shot or that yet another has a fractured skull doesn't change anything.Immigration Minister Scott Morrison is undoubtedly right when he describes this violent episode on Manus Island as a ''terrible tragedy''. In fact, he's more right than he knows. Tragedy, in the Greek sense, unfolds as an inevitability. The very thing that makes the tragic hero so tragic is that his fate is sealed, his demise is clear, but he continues to take every step that leads him there. And in the case of Manus Island, that is exactly where we are.We don't get to be outraged because this violence, with its brutal, deadly consequences, is inherent. We chose it, even if we've refused at every stage to acknowledge that. It is the very logic of our asylum seeker policy - which is built on the sole rationality of deterrence - to create horror. We're banking on it.So now, let us make this calculus finally explicit: whatever these people are fleeing, whatever circumstance makes them think they'd be better off chancing death on boats hardly worthy of that description, we must offer them something worse. That something is Papua New Guinea.The worse it is, the more effective it is destined to be, and the more it fulfils the philosophical intentions of the policy. This tragedy is not any kind of evidence of policy failure. It is, in fact, the very best form of deterrence. This is what it looks like when the policy works.For now, we're busily piecing together exactly what happened. Hence the immediate calls for an inquiry. We assemble the facts as a necessary ritual, but it's ultimately an irrelevance. If it turns out that these asylum seekers were set upon by the PNG police or by locals, what difference will it really make? It will merely have demonstrated what we have long known: that PNG is a highly dangerous, deeply unliveable country, racked by lawlessness and violence. The capital, Port Moresby, is routinely listed among the least liveable cities on the planet. Last year, The Economist had it third-worst, besting only Damascus and Dhaka, and therefore ranking below most of the cities these detainees have fled. And that's the reason the policy of transferring boat people to PNG is meant to work: because we're pointedly not offering these people protection if they're found to be refugees.And if the detainees are found to have triggered the violence? No doubt such a finding would be useful fodder for those determined to present them as villains, undeserving of our sympathy or protection. That, after all, is the narrative that surrounds asylum seekers whenever this sort of thing happens. But that only highlights an essential fact: this sort of thing keeps happening.Labor, unable to criticise the policy that has delivered us this death because it is theirs, can only present this as some kind of managerial problem; as evidence that the Abbott government is mismanaging the centre. But riotous violence happened repeatedly on its watch, in Nauru and Villawood, as in Baxter and Woomera previously. Onshore, offshore, it didn't matter. Labor's objections - even in this utterly lame, limp form - are political and disingenuous.When social behaviour repeats itself like this, we have two explanations open to us. One is that this is a coincidence of sorts: that it is nothing more than the misbehaviour of immoral individuals gaming the system, and that these individuals merely happen to pop up repeatedly.This is very much the explanation favoured by officialdom - from both major parties - who immediately declare these rioters to have failed any decent character test, having revealed themselves as criminally inclined.The other explanation is that there is something about the circumstances of detainees that generates this behaviour. Put any group of people through this wringer, and they will eventually respond with riotous protest. Such behaviour, then, is not a function of the defective personalities of individuals, but the inevitable human reaction to inhuman treatment: that the violence we've witnessed over and over is simply a product of the system.Naturally, officials cannot abide this. Certainly, they are keen on talking about our ''system'', and preserving its integrity. But they present it as entirely passive; as a set of rules and processes that facilitate orderly management, rather than something active in its own right. As far as politicians are concerned, our systems don't have consequences.This, of course, is bollocks. But it's bipartisan bollocks, so for most relevant purposes it masquerades as truth.That's why we're blind to it. We respond to a detainee killed, but seem far less moved by the several to have committed suicide, as though they are somehow less dead.Through it all we maintain the heroic ability to exonerate ourselves through the fiction that we played no part in their misery, or that those who riot are immorally cynical. But the cynicism is ours. Even the briefest sampling of commercial talkback radio this week revealed a streak within us that sees a detainee's death merely as comeuppance. The political truth is that there is almost nothing any government could do that the electorate would deem too brutal, which is precisely how we got here.A poll last month had 60 per cent of us urging the Abbott government to ''increase the severity'' of our policies towards asylum seekers. That's not a pragmatic policy judgment. We find something cathartic about this official form of violence.The truth is we've never really come to terms with why it is people get on boats, and why it is that, faced with hopeless inaction once they're detained, they protest. In fact, our public conversation isn't even terribly interested in knowing. That's why, when we do finally discover the facts of Manus, they will mean nothing.
**********Labor wins the debate, Abbott eyes the prize********September 6, 2013******78**** It started with pious calls for ''consensus politics''. Remember them? How Bob Katter enthused about a ''new paradigm''? Julia Gillard called for a ''new politics'', which I can only assume was roughly equivalent to Tony Abbott's ''kinder, gentler polity''.Then followed the most bitter, cantankerous Parliament in generations, in which every mere breath would be contested.Now, after all that exhausting, dispiriting muck, the end result has been a quite astonishing consensus. At the eleventh hour, and almost without anyone noticing, the biggest disagreements of the past three years (the carbon tax aside) have been dissolved. Perhaps most astonishingly, several of them have been resolved in favour of the Labor government we now look set to eject.On Saturday the country will elect a party with an expensive national broadband network policy. It will vote for a party that will significantly increase education funding, at least for four years. And it will elect a party that has resolved that the best way to handle asylum seekers arriving by boat is just to kick them out so some other country has to deal with them. Sure, differences remain between the parties on these issues. Some of these differences even matter: there are still fights to be had. But they are now over matters of detail rather than essence.You know something is happening when Abbott is explicitly spruiking a ''unity ticket'' with Kevin Rudd on education funding (even though he fails to match Labor for the most expensive years of the Gonski plan).All this is a long way from the days when the NBN was a ''white elephant'' - a ''colossal waste of taxpayers' money'' that the Coalition had solemnly pledged to ''dismantle''. Now, as Alan Kohler observed when the Coalition finally proposed an alternative NBN of its own, ''Malcolm Turnbull's great achievement over the past 2½ years has been to save the national broadband network''. It's a long way, too, from Christopher Pyne's dismissal of Gonski as ''a conski''; from his insistence that ''the status quo is a better model'' of education funding, before unabashedly declaring ''Labor should have been doing this last year'' and deciding to ''adopt exactly the same funding envelope as Labor''.But the grandest, most Damascene conversion has come on fiscal policy. For years the Coalition has held Labor at gunpoint, demanding a return to surplus as some kind of litmus test for good government. For years, and for reasons unfathomable, Labor has played along. Having taken the perfectly defensible Keynesian path of running a deficit to stimulate the economy during a global recession, it became so obsessed with proving its deficit was temporary that it simply forgot to argue its case.The entire economic conversation revolved around a promised return to surplus by 2012-13. Nothing could divert Labor from this course. Not even a gigantic natural disaster such as the Queensland floods in 2011. If ever there was a reason - or even an excuse - to shelve the surplus and build the nation, this was it. Instead, Labor introduced a levy, pledged to cut spending and held fast to a promise no economist seemed to think was a good idea, and which it could never keep. The scene was bizarre. In its zealous search for a surplus, Labor kept trying to find cuts to government spending. This, of course, deflates the economy. So the Reserve Bank was frantically cutting interest rates in an attempt to stimulate. Here we had two institutions beavering away at cancelling each other out.Even when it became clear last year that both company profits and wages were falling - effectively destroying the government's tax revenue - Labor still insisted it could cut its way to surplus. By Christmas it had to concede. The surplus, once a holy grail and unexplained economic necessity, became an irresponsible goal that would compromise ''jobs and growth''. And thus ended one of Labor's most foolhardy, damaging attempts to appease the Coalition.Only now, the Coalition has converted, too. The most underrated phrase of this entire campaign was Joe Hockey's plan for ''appropriate stimulus'', even if that meant we'd have to forget about the surplus for a while. This is the same Coalition that seemed so resolutely not to believe in stimulus that it argued against it even during the financial crisis. Well, forget that. We're all Keynesians now.Rudd can argue all he likes that Abbott will cut the economy to shreds and plunge it into recession but he has two problems. First, this contradicts everything Labor was telling us when it insisted it would find whatever cuts were necessary to deliver that surplus. Second, Abbott has freed himself from the shackles of finding a surplus, thus allowing him to shelve spending cuts until there's no danger of a recession. He has manoeuvred this beautifully, as Labor should have done from the start.All this is a testament to the brutal efficiency of Abbott's opposition.He's quite prepared to bludgeon the government with an argument he later rejects. It's shameless but it works because he does it with confidence and a straight face. Contrast Labor, which has spent far too much time answering the Coalition's charges rather than telling its own story, in its own political terms. If it falls, it will certainly leave a legacy: disability insurance, broadband, Gonski. But we won't really know what that legacy means because it has never really told us. Besides, these are Coalition policies now, too. In so many ways, Labor has won the arguments it refused to have, and for which it will receive no reward.
