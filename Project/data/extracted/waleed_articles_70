**********Tony Abbott's faux IR attack laid bare********February 7, 2014******223**** Liberal backbencher and member for Murray Sharman Stone is presently the most effective opposition leader in the country. She's across her brief, argues her case powerfully and directly and carries with her an undeniable sincerity that spectacularly subordinates her own career advancement prospects to the interests of her constituents.But, perhaps most profoundly, she has managed in the space of a week to surround the government with a series of intractable questions that drive at the heart of exactly what this hitherto opaque government is really trying to achieve. Stone is making the government transparent.To be clear, she almost certainly does not intend anything so grand. Her aim is simply to reverse her colleagues' decision to deny SPC Ardmona the $25 million it apparently needs to keep operating.But when you accuse your own boss of "lying" and "hypocrisy", and when you lay bare the political imperatives of making election promises to marginal seats that contradict the decisions you make in safe ones, you inevitably open a vein. This is no longer just about whether or not the government's decision is justified. It's about why it has chosen to present this issue the way it has.Why did Prime Minister Tony Abbott so grossly misrepresent SPC's enterprise bargaining agreement, and the costs it imposes on the company? The government had coherent (even if contestable) reasons for its decision: SPC sits in a highly profitable company flush with its own cash to invest, unlike our debt-riddled government; giving money in these circumstances sets an appalling precedent of corporate welfare, inviting profitable businesses to queue up for handouts; this government is philosophically driven by the principle that it is for businesses to stand or fall on their own.Fleetingly, the government mentioned these. Since the storm of protest, it has fallen back on them. But for what Abbott has described as a "defining decision" of this government - one that underlines its firm philosophical commitment to non-intervention in the market and the end of corporate welfare - the government has now significantly muddied its own waters.There is scant justification for placing industrial relations at the centre of this story. Ask SPC why it's struggling and you get a very clear answer that emphatically has nothing to do with industrial relations. Employees' allowances, they've informed us, cost them $116,467 last year. Next to the $25 million they're after, that's piddling. In that context there was simply no need for Abbott to give the company, which he had just finished telling us was so well run, public advice on how bad its industrial arrangements are. SPC knows its industrial arrangements, considerably better than the government does, it turns out.No, the government's performance here is for the electorate.In this respect, the SPC decision is really chapter two. Chapter one came last week when Employment Minister Eric Abetz warned Australia risked "something akin to a wages explosion of the pre-Accord era when unsustainable wage growth simply pushed thousands of Australians out of work". As it happens, actual wage growth is the lowest we've ever seen, but Abetz wasn't talking about money. He was taking aim at conditions: too much leave and the like, making businesses less profitable.Abetz's evidence was thin, which is probably why economists broadly dismissed his claims. He drew on a few examples from the car-making and resources industries, which represent the extremes of our two-speed economy and not an economy-wide trend of over-generosity.But that is the portrait of our economy the government is urging on us: one where it is workers' conditions negotiated collectively with employers that cost jobs, and not the bigger underlying economic conditions such as the strength of our currency or our exposure to a global marketplace that often reciprocates with more protectionist measures than we afford ourselves.The SPC case, therefore, had to be bent into shape to fit this narrative. That's why the government emphasised things such as the EBA's "wet allowance", which means almost nothing to anyone, and for that precise reason sounds idiosyncratic and decadently, unjustifiably generous."Wet allowance? I don't have a wet allowance. No one has a wet allowance! Must be a rort!" thought the public. Or at least it did until it became clear this allowance covers the costs of protective gear for people whose job brings them into contact with dangerous chemicals, and that SPC no longer pays it anyway, preferring instead to buy the gear for the workers itself.Significantly, this narrative isn't simply one of union bashing. Listen to Abbott and Abetz and you'll note the companies are getting bashed as well. They're the ones Abetz describes as "weak-kneed", and who Abbott has urged to get their "house in order". What's happening here is a transference of responsibility: a declaration that our industrial relations are in total disrepair, but that it's not for the government to do anything about it.This, I suspect, is the Abbott government's way of establishing an industrial relations conversation, without having a policy debate on the issue. Abbott knows any discussion of policy will be politically catastrophic. He also faces enormous pressure from within his own movement to take back the territory the Coalition surrendered with John Howard's defeat.The solution seems to be to make it an issue independent of government; to illustrate slowly over time that the system is broken so that reform becomes possible. It's as though Abbott is trying to drag himself kicking and screaming towards a policy. But to do that his illustrations need to have punch. And all that is lost when your illustrations turn out to be caricatures.
**********Lebanon: Nation with no real unity stuck as proxy for region's conflict********January 10, 2014******10**** The National Museum of Beirut houses one of the greatest prehistoric collections in the world. It's here you'll find the earliest example we have of an alphabet in human history.You'll also find astonishing Egyptian-styled sarcophagi topped bizarrely with Greco-Roman faces; a fusion of artistic traditions that demonstrates just what a cultural meeting point this part of the world has always been.What you will not find is anything post-mediaeval.Modern Lebanon just does not exist in its national museum. It cannot exist because the cultures that meet there could never agree on what story should be told.Indeed, the museum's only modern artefact is the bullet hole from the Lebanese civil war that punctures the bottom-left corner of perhaps its most impressive Byzantine mosaic.So it is in Beirut, and indeed Lebanon as a whole. There are Sunni, Christian and Shiite areas, but there are no national areas. Nation-states typically go to great lengths to convey their propaganda to the public, to articulate a national mythology. But Lebanon does not even bother.Beirut has no monuments to independence, founding fathers or national heroes.It does not even have the oversized photos of presidents (or prime ministers) that are so compulsory throughout the Middle East. In Lebanon, modern heroes are sectarian, and modern national symbols are tragic and embody unresolved conflict. Like the Holiday Inn, left gutted and burnt from the civil war, sitting hauntingly among a clutch of shiny downtown high-rises. If there is a national identity in Lebanon, it is so heavily obscured by the bullet holes that very few of its politicians can see it.''Nations which don't find their national identities are doomed to be the prey of other nations.''So declared Ataturk in 1923. He was, of course, speaking with post-Ottoman Turkey in mind but it is hard to imagine a more penetrating description of Lebanon.After decades of watching its politicians play up sectarian divisions and seek support from foreign powers, Lebanon has become not so much a country as a theatre for regional geopolitics.And so the Shiites - most actively represented by Hezbollah - take orders from Iran and the Assad regime in Syria, while Sunnis seek support from Saudi Arabia and embrace Syria's increasingly radical rebels. No group can conceive of its own interests without its foreign patrons: not even Lebanon's Christians, who have floated back to Syria's Bashar al-Assad as their protector against Sunni radicalism.Just this past week, Beirut has had a former finance minister assassinated and a (Sunni) suicide bomber kill five civilians in a Shiite neighbourhood.And yet neither is a domestic Lebanese matter, because almost nothing is. The assassination is most likely an order from Syria, reasserting Assad's will in Lebanon. The suicide bombing is clear retaliation for Hezbollah's involvement in the Syrian civil war, fighting for the Assad regime. It is an involvement that has merely encouraged the same international terrorist groups fighting Assad to start terrorising Lebanon, thereby exposing Hezbollah's claim to be ''resisting'' foreign aggression on behalf of Lebanon as a sham, and making clear that they are merely providing Lebanese muscle for Iran.Saudi Arabia is offering $3 billion to strengthen the Lebanese Army. Its aim seems obvious enough: to gain influence over the only viable military alternative to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Lebanese Sunnis are likely to welcome it, because they would love a Lebanese army sympathetic to their interests. The Shiites, however, are in a bind. Do they really want a strong Lebanese army, or would they prefer it to remain weak enough for Hezbollah to dominate?It boils down to this: Lebanon is a contest between the two real powers of the region - Saudi Arabia and Iran. And in this respect, Lebanon is a microcosm; a place that merely distils the real game of Middle Eastern politics. It is visible in the Syrian civil war, which is far less civil than it seems since it has become a proxy confrontation between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which is cheerfully funding rebel groups, hoping desperately for Assad to fall. It is visible in Saudis' outraged reaction to America's nuclear deal with Iran last November.It is even visible in Iraq where Iran has profited handsomely from America's removal of Saddam Hussein and the emergence of a Shiite government, and where the Saudi government stands accused of funding Sunni terrorist groups which have spectacularly gained control of Fallujah.The Sunni-Shiite divide is now definitive. But it is more manufactured than it first appears: a convenient dividing line the Saudis and Iranians can use to mobilise support. Only recently has this sectarianism become so radioactive. Most deeply, these divisions are political. This is an old story of competing nations - here acting as empires - dividing for conquest.And here we return to Ataturk's dictum. This Saudi-Iran havoc is possible because the Middle East is crammed with countries whose national identities have never truly been resolved; whose borders have been horrifically drawn to capture almost nothing coherent; who shook off colonisation only to discover they did not quite know who they were in these new, often arbitrary political formations.
**********Tony Abbott running against himself as marathon turns into a sprint********December 27, 2013******393**** This year, we've had three prime ministers, Victoria has had two premiers, the Northern Territory has had two chief ministers (and, while we're at it, Catholics have had two Popes). In only one case was an election and a change of government involved.It's possible to see this as the assembly of unconnected coincidences, as though this remarkable tally is to be consigned to the annals of trivia, indicative of nothing. It's possible to explain each of these leadership transitions on its own terms: the Gillard-Rudd fiasco - and Abbott's subsequent ascension - as a function of a dysfunctional Labor Party; Ted Baillieu's demise as the failure of a weak leader; Terry Mills as the victim of a diabolical policy decision to raise electricity prices in the Northern Territory.But in one year? It's as though time is being compressed. I mark this year as one in which the consequences of a public and political culture operating at warp speed started to become clear.Already there's evidence the velocity is set to continue. The Abbott government, having barely been in office 100 days, already trails in the polls. It has enjoyed nothing even approximating a honeymoon period, and more than that has failed to even enjoy a phase of post-election inertia where the electorate looks elsewhere and just sticks with its decision.In falling behind so quickly, the government has set a new record; this despite having taken over from a Labor government that even sympathisers would quietly concede was unelectable, despite facing an opposition that has hardly been rampaging.History says it's very unlikely, but it's possible Abbott will be a one-term prime minister. Like Gillard. And Rudd. Maybe it's too early to say a cross-partisan pattern is emerging in Australian politics, but it's certainly not too early to ask.There are lots of explanations available for the government's early slide. Its botched education policy. Its attempt to trim its media profile runs the risk of looking evasive, particularly on its signature policy area of immigration. The relationship with Indonesia has taken a beating on its watch, even if the spying activity that has so enraged the Indonesians came from Labor's time in office. Coalition MPs have been caught spending taxpayers' money in dubious circumstances.And, perhaps most importantly, Australia never heartily embraced Abbott's Coalition. That much was evident the morning after the election, when it became clear that most of the swing away from Labor and the Greens went to novelty parties, with the Coalition picking up less than a quarter of it.If it's true the electorate never really warmed to Abbott, it's because his style in opposition was so aggressive that there was little warmth to go around. But it's also true that this is exactly the reason he's now Prime Minister. It was a stunningly successful method that had Labor on the ropes for almost an entire electoral term. His critics will say he bludgeoned the electorate with simplistic sloganeering, and that the noise made life impossible for a government running a complex series of arguments. Maybe. But why did it work?I think it's because Abbott's approach was so perfectly suited to the age. Much has been written about the 24-hour news cycle, and the culture of sound-bite politics it generates. All that is true. But the problem is much bigger than that. It's society-wide.Our entire mode of living is now built on speed. We communicate instantly and constantly, and we command an impressive array of gadgets to facilitate this. The very moment we receive news, we're reacting to it, usually with virtual people whose role - either as ideological friend or foe - is pre-determined.A political development is not as important as the immediate argument we intend to prosecute with it. We've arranged ourselves into teams, and we take our cues from our teammates. We're becoming captive to a kind of digital tribalism.This is a whole new sociology, and it brings with it a whole new politics of obstinate, snap judgment. Put simply, we commit too hard, too early. That's why political parties take the huge step of replacing leaders so much quicker than they used to. They know we're not really for turning any more. And that's because, while we're smothered with information, we simply don't have time to digest it.But since we all have megaphones now, it's unthinkable to be silent; to have nothing to say. So we make noise. And, in the process, what we're losing as a society is the capacity for reflection.That is a social environment fundamentally suited to the task of opposition. Abbott seemed to know that instinctively. He asked us to judge, rather than reflect. And he set up rapidly digestible templates to help us make those snap judgments. Templates that would undermine any government, like: unpredictability and crises in government are a result of incompetence. Hence ''no surprises, no excuses''. Thus did he vanquish two prime ministers.Now, as his government faces its own surprises, and necessarily must find the odd excuse, it fails its own tests from opposition. Sure, every government is wobbly early, and there's every chance this one will find its feet and recover. But if it doesn't, it could be that Tony Abbott is his own third scalp.
**********Holden demise the price of a global economy********December 13, 2013******159**** In the short term, there's no consistency in politics. Back when the Gillard government announced the carbon tax, it took about six seconds for the Coalition to scream this would cost jobs and devastate entire towns. Bollocks, retorted Labor, occasionally by way of karaoke.Sure, some industries would be hit, but they were the kind of industries the environment needed us to scale back. Meanwhile, we would create shiny, eco-friendly jobs. People would retrain and find new opportunities. The workforce was adaptable and dynamic.Now, with nobody really noticing, Labor and the Coalition seem to have swapped positions. As Labor inspects the carcass of the Australian car industry, it foreshadows monstrous job losses, the devastation of manufacturing towns in South Australia and Victoria, and protests that you can't simply ask people who have spent their lives assembling cars suddenly to work in nursing homes. And the Coalition is suddenly brimming with confidence that these things are always transient, evolving and ultimately leave us stronger.But in the long run, things are far more consistent than all that. The truth is that the death of Australian car making did not begin on election day, September 7, but 30 years ago, when the Hawke government began abolishing tariffs and opening us to global competition.This was declared a necessary step in Australia's economic evolution. It would bring growth, dynamism and, after some pain, prosperity.When Labor today argues the Coalition is sacrificing blue-collar workers at the altar of an economic theory, it omits that, in Australia, Labor was that very theory's midwife. Ask Paul Keating. Actually, don't bother. He's already given his answer when asked what he'd say to blue-collar workers whose jobs disappeared on his watch: "What do I say? 'What's your new job like.' … I mean, did we ever hurt anybody liberating them from the car assembly line?"For now, an argument rages on whether more government money would have saved Holden. The opposition insists $150 million would have done it. The government points out that Holden, like Ford before it, has been "saved" in this manner several times before, only to be unsaved and threaten to leave again. The truth is we'll never know because Holden won't tell us, and even if it did, it would be guessing.Either way, the government's argument is interesting because it boils down to the assertion that there is nothing it could reasonably have done to prevent this; that this decision was out of its hands and was based on economic factors largely beyond its control. But in defending itself, the government has made an epic admission: that we're not really in control of our economy.And that much is the heretical truth. We chose to make it true when we threw our lot in with the global free market. We'll never admit this in stark terms. We'll continue to argue over each sensational development such as this week's. But the grander theme cannot be resisted: we do not call our own shots; no longer is there a hierarchy with the nation-state on top and everyone else - corporations, civil society and citizens - below.Power is shared now. Companies play countries off against each other looking for the best deal, much as we haggle over a shop purchase. Our world isn't exactly borderless - and some countries are more protectionist than others - but those borders now seem to denote zones rather than dominions. The world is a country now, and nations are its cities.That's where the difficulties start. The idea of an economy is that people can move within it, that labour flows to where it is most needed. In the case of car making, our workers just aren't needed. Not because they're not good at what they do, but because countless other people are good at it, too, and for a fraction of the cost.It's not just Australia experiencing this. Take Japan, that car-making behemoth. It's lost about a quarter of its industry in the past five years. Even South Korea, whose workers earn about half of what ours do, has been in decline since 2011. These cars are now made in China and Thailand. Cheaply.Remember Gina Rinehart's declaration that Australia can't compete while Africans are prepared to work for $2 per day? The problem with her argument is not that she's wrong. It's that, by the global free market's own lights, she is scandalously right.Those lights tell us to specialise; to do what we can do better, or cheaper than anyone else. That's the logic we've embraced. Just last week we signed a free trade agreement with South Korea, which both major parties had worked on. The upshot: great for agriculture, bad for car making. Labor didn't quibble. Trade Minister Andrew Robb said the agreement was about "backing our strengths". That's what we do now.But nations are diverse. People within them have a huge range of skills. Globalisation's demand that every nation specialise sits in contradiction with the social fact that not everyone is well placed to fit within our specialties. The market has its solution to that, too: labour mobility. You either acquire new skills or go where your skills will be rewarded. But the social and political reality is more complicated. Perpetual reskilling is expensive and not always successful, and Holden's workforce isn't about to move to Thailand.The larger story here isn't really about our car industry, or whether we could have delayed Holden's decision to some other day. It's about the fact our politics don't match our economics: that the assumptions of a hyper-specialised global free market and its effortlessly mobile labour force don't reflect the more diversified, comparatively static nature of our societies.Twenty years from now, Holden's departure will be just another marker on a journey the direction of which is clear and irreversible. We'll continue shedding industries. We'll continue developing new ones.But no one can honestly guarantee the same people harmed in the first process will be rescued by the second. And the political heat this generates will merely disguise the fact that this is a matter of political consensus. Waleed Aly presents Drive on Radio National.
