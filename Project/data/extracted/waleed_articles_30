**********Government's call to reject Australian IS defectors an opportunity lost********May 28, 2015******395**** As things stand, you could murder the Queen, the Governor-General and the Prime Minister, and keep your citizenship. You'd be guilty of treason. You'd almost certainly go to prison for life. But you'd die as an incarcerated Australian, even if you had dual citizenship.Australians, you see, can be just about anything. We can be frauds, armed robbers and rapists; embezzlers, torturers and serial killers. We'll be named, shamed and imprisoned for these things, but none of them we deem sufficient to extinguish our nationality. If you're born an Australian citizen, it's damn hard to lose that.That's what is so significant about the Abbott government's policy, confirmed this week, to strip dual nationals who've joined ISIL of their Australian citizenship. It reveals that these crimes exist in a separate category, characterised not merely by their badness, but by their betrayal.That's what makes terrorism such a special case even though it kills so few Australians compared to, say, car accidents or domestic violence. Those events we characterise (however incorrectly) as private tragedies: offences against private victims. Terrorism is an offence against our public selves. The scale of its repugnance lies not in the direct damage it does, which is limited, but in the symbolic damage inherent in such a violent rejection of the collective us.That's why there's a catharsis in stripping citizenship from these people. It's a secular act of excommunication. And, just like its religious counterpart, it makes us feel better about those still in the fold. We're purifying ourselves of disbelievers. But this implicitly requires us to view terrorism in one of two ways: either as war, or as unconventional politics.The war analogy, of course, has dominated our discourse on terrorism since the September 11 attacks, and explains why it is that the only other way for a dual national to lose an Australian citizenship acquired at birth is to serve in the armed forces of a country fighting ours. But hereabouts we run into problems. First, that if the post-9/11 era has taught us anything, it is that treating terrorism as war has been a ghastly failure. It has only compounded the disaster and amplified the problem to the extent we now consider a terrorist attack on home soil more likely than at any other time in our history.But secondly – and more intriguingly – this approach is increasingly at odds with the way governments and security organisations are talking about terrorism. This is the era of "radicalisation"; of lone-wolves and kids succumbing to radical propaganda. Islamic State, as it confronts us in Australia, is not a conventional army or even a structured terrorist organisation, but a movement to which people recruit themselves. That's why the Prime Minister spends so much time talking about the role of the internet. It's why we talk about young Muslims being "groomed" by recruiters in a similar way to the victims of paedophiles. We're beginning to recognise that we can't simply bomb terrorism out of existence. The task now is to persuade people not to be seduced. No military can do that. That is a task of politics.The trouble, though, is that we take the logic of terrorism as politics only so far before we abandon it. Take the other major recent development: Australians who've gone to Syria only to discover that beneath Islamic State's utopian promise is a gruesome lie. Now they're trying to get out and come home. And as more Australians inevitably make the same discovery, we'll see a lot more of this.This might just be the best news we've had in a year. We've been sweating on precisely this kind of crack in the edifice of IS propaganda. The truth is that we can brand IS as "death cult" all we like. We can condemn it on some kind of relentless loop if it satisfies us but, in practical terms, none of it means a thing when it comes from the mainstream. Radical politics expects mainstream rejection – indeed it requires that for its own legitimacy. When we tell ourselves how evil IS is, we need to be clear: this is a performance for our own benefit, not to persuade people who might otherwise be charmed.The one thing radical politics cannot withstand is when its own true believers reveal its hypocrisy. The Caliph may have no clothes, but it's his subjects who must call it out. And yet it is precisely at this juncture that we refuse to take advantage.Asked about the possible return of such people, the government eagerly reiterates: we don't want them back, but if we must receive them, we have no interest in anything other than punishing them. That impulse is easy to understand: after all, the crime is clear. But is the impulse strategic? Are these people of more use to us stuck in Syria than they would be telling other Australians about the horrors of IS with vastly more credibility than anyone else? Is the aim to punish them, or stem further recruitment? Are we after vengeance, or some manner of victory?To be clear, I'm not advocating such crimes go unpunished. Even the lawyers of these people accept they'll be prosecuted. But it's telling that we can see nothing beyond this; that we so resolutely refuse even to acknowledge this potential gift because we're too busy reiterating our hatred for these people. Somehow, it was easier to accept the idea of Soviet spies defecting to the West in the Cold War than it is for us to imagine someone might have joined ISIL naively, and has discovered their error.Maybe that's because they rejected us first. Maybe it's an extension of the catharsis we feel when we extinguish someone's citizenship. But here's the danger: by rejecting anything that doesn't begin and end with condemnation – as if by reflex – we're surrendering the politics of terrorism in precisely the way ISIL so effectively isn't.
**********Watch out: this is a booby-trapped budget********May 14, 2015******281**** So, what now? Now that a government that once made a budget surplus the key determinant of government competence has reached a point where it cannot even forecast one, and yet claims victory. Now that a government once so proudly congratulating itself for its "tough" decisions has abandoned most of them and gleefully refused  to make any more. Now that the Coalition has ended up more or less where Labor did: trying to stimulate a spluttering economy at the expense of a balanced budget.It's not the U-turns that intrigue me. Politics is, after all, a never-ending festival of backflips, sometimes for the better. It is the fact that if you squint - really, really hard - you can see the ghost of a new consensus emerging. The big question in politics, bigger even than who is in power, is who is setting the terms of the debate. This, for its entire life, was the previous Labor government's precise problem. It spent years playing on the Coalition's terms, trying to prove it could deliver a surplus, and asking to be judged accordingly. Now, it's the Coalition asking to be judged on Labor's terms. "I don't want anyone to say that this is an unfair budget," said Tony Abbott ahead of his sophomore effort. This - and not a focus on the deficit - was the test of success. So he shovelled money at small business.Maybe we're agreed, then. Prioritise economic growth over a surplus for the next few years, and don't smash the poor and vulnerable. Truth be told, that's pretty much what the OECD asked us to do last year. It's what the bulk of economists have been recommending for an age, even while the previous Labor government dutifully ignored them. Maybe it took a year of catastrophic polling for this government to listen, but in a fashion, it has. Leaving the cynicism for a moment, that deserves some congratulations.Which is what makes the next bit so puzzling. Confronted with the obvious questions about the suddenly extinguished budget emergency - noting particularly that the numbers are worse now than when the "emergency" was first declared - the Prime Minister unleashed a reflex: "every Coalition budget should be a tax-cutting budget". Except, if you keep doing that, eventually your budget is truly exploded. To put it in the folksy household budget terms politicians so adore, it's a bit like someone whose family is struggling with bills marching into the boss' office at the start of every year and demanding a pay cut.  At some point, the government will need more tax. And yet at the merest whiff of the thought, Abbott instinctively becomes an opposition leader again: "It's so typical of the Labor Party that they immediately want to see more tax, not less" he boomed last week. This week, he embellished: "They all live on Planet Tax ... this man [Bill Shorten] is the taxing expert of our country".  And yet, this government has just launched its own tax review. A review that specifically contemplates raising the GST and shrinking the loopholes in negative gearing and capital gains tax. A review that questions the tax concessions on superannuation, echoing the concerns of former Commonwealth Bank chiefs and treasury secretaries past and present who agree these concessions are poorly targeted, skewed to the wealthy and cost the budget a monstrous amount. A review that allowed the Treasurer to boast that everything was up for grabs: "We haven't done what our predecessors did and start ruling things in and out". That criticism of Labor - based on its handling of the Henry Tax Review - is entirely justified. Or at least it was for the five minutes it took for his boss to do the same thing. Now, Abbott is apparently ruling out everything that's called a tax.That can only mean one thing, assuming the government still cares about the budget at all: more cuts. Lots of them. Serious cuts. Cuts like the ones that set the country on fire and decimated the government's political prospects a year ago. Even as it stands, the government's forecast reduced deficits over time rely on one of the most controversial cuts of them all: the $80 billion it took away from health and education in last year's budget. That's still there. In fact, it's among the biggest elements in this budget. There can only be more of that kind of thing to come. And the thing about cuts is they almost always affect the most disadvantaged people most, for the very good reason that they're usually the ones already most reliant on government spending. That revives the fairness problem. And that would take this government back to ground zero.That's why it's worth remembering how we got here. How it is the government ended up with such a diabolical debut budget that it had to abrogate all of its principles within a year. That budget was a product of a series of contradictory promises: to abolish taxes, cut nothing and somehow return the budget to surplus. Something had to give. Abbott's pre-election promises meant he had booby-trapped his own budget.But now the government is booby-trapping future ones. It's pledging to reduce the debt, raise no taxes and always be fair. Again, something will have to give. So again, what now? Because if recent history has taught us anything, it's that you can win elections on such contradictory foundations, but it's diabolical to govern on them.
**********Why Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran never stood a chance ********May 1, 2015******458**** Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are not simply the victims of their own crimes and a sadly corrupted judicial process. In a tragic way, they are so much less than that: pawns surrendered for ostensibly greater things. Now that it is done, we can admit the truth we were suppressing – that they never stood a chance. All the videos and the vigils, all the diplomacy and the lobbying, were never going to conjure a miracle. Their lives stood at the intersection of a suite of circumstances that had ordained a course for them. And perhaps most gallingly, those circumstances had nothing to do with them. Their deaths are simply the debris.It begins with their arrest, and a thing called the Treaty of Mutual Assistance on Criminal Matters. Chances are Chan and Sukumaran had never heard of this, but – their own catastrophic decision to traffic heroin aside – it might just be the single biggest reason they are now dead. That treaty requires our police to help their Indonesian counterparts with criminal investigations; to locate and identify potential criminals. And it's under these arrangements that the AFP decided to tell the Indonesians about the Bali nine's trafficking plans. They did it in writing in the most explicit terms: "should they suspect that Chan and/or the couriers are in possession of drugs at the time of their departure (from Indonesia, they should) take what action they deem appropriate". Then they wrote another letter telling the Indonesians the dates and times of their flights home to Australia, advising them to make their arrests on that day. And so the Indonesians did what they deemed appropriate. Ultimately, as it turned out, that involved a bullet through the heart.It's not every day a country's authorities play a key role in having its own citizens put to death in a foreign country. Exactly why we did this has never been fully explained. We know the AFP has the right under the treaty to refuse assisting the Indonesians in cases where the death penalty may apply. We also know they can insist on an assurance that the death penalty won't be applied before they co-operate. But it's true this only applies when charges are pending, and in the Bali nine's case, they hadn't even been arrested, much less come near being charged. This, I can only guess, is the AFP's reasoning. But we shouldn't be guessing. It is a good thing that they'll finally tell their story before a parliamentary committee.But whatever the technical explanation, they can only underscore the broader reason. This was 2005. Three years after the Bali bombings, three months before London. We were in the throes of the War on Terror, worried about Indonesian terrorist groups and desperate to beef up Indonesian policing. We wanted their co-operation on terrorism, they wanted our co-operation on drugs. The Bali nine fit this bill. In this sense, Chan and Sukumaran are collateral damage in our War on Terror.That put them at the mercy of the Indonesian justice system, clearly given to harsh penalties and struggling with corruption. At length their only hope would reside not in law, but in politics. Their lives would rest on the whims of the Indonesian president, and the power of Australian diplomacy. Here again, circumstance was conspiring against them. Joko Widodo is a new president, searching for authority. His win followed a bruising campaign against a former military general with a strong nationalist streak and a sobering human rights history. Thus was Jokowi – the anti-corruption, pro-human-rights candidate – mercilessly attacked for being soft, insufficiently patriotic. And so his early period in office seems to have been all about fighting this perception. Within months he had ordered that three Vietnamese fishing boats that entered Indonesian waters be sunk, and pledged to commence executing drug convicts. Mercy was quite simply not an option for a president obsessed with the politics of toughness for his own domestic purposes. Hence the summary dismissal of clemency pleas. Hence his failure even to grasp the basics of Chan and Sukumaran's case. When he thundered about the drugs they were bringing into Indonesia, he revealed not only that he had no idea they were in fact leaving for Australia, but that any such facts would disintegrate before the demands of his hairy-chested political narrative. It takes an enormous amount of political capital to dissuade a politician in that sort of mood. Australia simply didn't have that capital. In fact, we had been systematically torching it under successive governments. These themes are well rehearsed now: suspending beef exports, spying, and our belligerent approach to border protection with scant regard for Indonesia's concerns or even sovereignty. Indonesia's anger has been clear and growing for years now. No doubt some of that rage is cynically confected for domestic consumption, but the underlying sense that we feel entitled to push them around is not mere theatre. In seeking clemency we were asking for a favour – one that would cost Jokowi some skin. And we were asking at a time when they were hardly inclined to give it. That was Chan's and Sukumaran's final disaster.Perhaps at another time, in another political world, these men would have been spared. Perhaps their comprehensive rehabilitation would have counted for something. But at this time, in this world, they were rendered the most peripheral characters in their own tragic story. Everywhere they went they were in someone's sights. And everywhere they turned was an altar on which they would be sacrificed.
**********In opposing the anti-vaccination movement, a sledgehammer cannot win battle of the needle********April 17, 2015******372**** Let me be clear. I am no fan of the anti-vaccination movement. I can't stand the free-riding hypocrisy that, under the protective, disease-free cover of everyone else's dutiful vaccination, affords itself the luxury of a "personal choice" to abstain. I shudder at the easy suspicion of profit-hungry "Big Pharma" that somehow vanishes at the feet of essential oil merchants or alternative therapists, despite their own bulging profits.I detest the unprincipled scepticism of medical science that so brazenly rejects the prevention  vaccination offers, but the moment something strikes, rushes to the emergency ward with total trust, seeking a cure. And the sheer quackery that, even after the most thorough scientific discrediting, persists in connecting vaccination to autism? As the father of an autistic son, this stirs in me a uniquely furious revulsion. I lack the words for it, and words are kind of what I do.But rage is the enemy of wisdom. It delivers no understanding of the anti-vaccination problem (which it greatly exaggerates), and no insight that might solve it. It feels good to vent rage, but frankly, whatever we decide to do about vaccination, the aim shouldn't be to make me feel good. That's what we decided to do this week with our "no jab, no pay" policy. There's something purging about attacking welfare payments. This is how we express who we hate. When we condemn someone to a life without welfare we're doing more than denying them money: we're sending them into a symbolic exile. Welfare is our way of expressing whatever tiny residue remains of social solidarity. To be ineligible is to be outcast, excluded from the social contract. That's why we so gleefully withdraw it from people we feel have violated the pact – lately, terrorists and anti-vaxxers. It's as though it's the final site of moral judgment left in our post-moral society. It is therefore where we begin the ritual stripping of rights.Is that the aim, though? Are we looking for a symbolic excommunication here? Or are we trying to get more people immunised? Our political class (of almost every stripe) will admit only to the latter, but if we take them at their word, we run into problems. As several health experts agreed this week, withdrawing welfare from anti-vaxxers is unlikely to make much practical difference for the very simple reason that they aren't typically on welfare in the first place. If this policy has any benefit at all, it is likely to be where people have simply forgotten to get their vaccinations up to date. And that's great. But there is surely a less punitive and more effective way to achieve this. You know, one that doesn't mean only rich people have the right to forget.We're failing to understand that vaccine refusal isn't some garden variety act of neglect or parental irresponsibility. It's not mere thoughtlessness. It's a conviction. It fits within a world view, and is alloyed to a broader politics. These politics are diverse, and change through the years, but they've always been there, ever since the first attempts at compulsory vaccination in the 19th century.  Back then many anti-vaxxers were from the working class. For them, vaccination was a form of class oppression: it was the ruling class treating their inferiors as the very personification of disease; as though poor people were themselves contagious. Theirs was a protest not just against vaccine, but against the idea of policing and dominating the working class. Their middle-class counterparts objected more on libertarian grounds. Like many of today's American anti-vaxxers, they simply held the government has no business being in our lives and rejected outright the idea of being policed through medical treatment.  If there is a truly modern strain of anti-vaccination, it is the New Age objector; suspicious of the whole enterprise of medical science, entranced by the human body's ability to heal itself, forever celebrating the natural over the synthetic. For them, health is not granted by chemicals. It is, instead, socially determined. It's about your diet, your environment, the depth of your friendships. But this, too, reflects deeper political convictions that object not merely to the act of vaccination, but the whole onslaught of capitalism. This posits a world where the irresistible power of money and politics combine to turn every human problem into a profit; where products we don't need are forced upon us and our humanity buried beneath mounds of branded debris. This is not a politics of selfishness. It is instead a politics about power. They resist the corporate onslaught, and in the process seek to empower themselves.It is only when you recognise that this is a problem of politics – rather than a battle of wills – that you can see where the "no jab, no pay" approach might lead. Perhaps you will never convince the hardcore anti-vaxxers who will happily sacrifice some welfare payments for their principles in the rare case it comes to that. But between the hardcore groupings are those who are more sceptical of mass vaccination than irascibly opposed. They're the ones broadly sympathetic with the libertarian or anti-corporate concerns at play, but perhaps unsure about the application of these ideas to vaccination. They're the ones who, with the right handling, might just be persuaded.  But what would someone like that make of this latest piece of political theatre? If you're on the verge of believing this is some form of government control, is anything more likely to tip you over the edge than the government resorting to force? That's the way radical politics works. It gains its strength from the very fact of its mainstream isolation.You don't win such political debates with a sledgehammer. You  win them with persuasion, and occasionally guile. Some American states have had success by allowing broad grounds for refusal, but requiring burdensome paperwork from anyone seeking to refuse. That whittles refusal down only to the true believers who can be bothered, which greatly reduces the threat to public health.  What it doesn't do, is take away people's rights, thereby encouraging those with alternative politics to harden their positions. What it doesn't do, is transform a public health issue into trench warfare. And that's ultimately what we need, because if there's anything worse than a war, it's one waged mainly to gratify ourselves.
**********Job done: Tony Abbott promises dull budget, but when did Australia's debt become manageable?********March 20, 2015******201**** What a sales pitch! Dull. Not visionary. Not even tough or "courageous" (as political euphemism would have it). Dull. "This will be a budget to bore you witless," Tony Abbott seemed to be saying this week. It will be a festival of tedium. A shrine to the uninteresting. Ignore it. Please.This, of course, will not happen. No budget in living memory will be so anticipated because no budget has had such a politically self-destructive prequel. It's now simply a matter of record that last year's budget obliterated Abbott's electoral standing and emboldened an already unwieldy senate to dig in against him. Abbott may well regard that senate as "feral", but the only reason it can enjoy being so unapologetically difficult is that the public had first declared his budget to be feral.  The senators, far from irresponsible spoilers, were cast as valued protectors: guardians of civilised domesticity, holding back the savagery of a budgetary invasion. On some level, the government must know this. No doubt this is precisely why the government is now so desperate to be dull - and above all, inoffensive.But paradoxically, Abbott's pledge of a dull budget is wildly ambitious. This is mainly because it is asking us to believe several contradictory things at once. First, that the Coalition inherited a budget emergency. Second that its job of responding to that emergency has been relentlessly sabotaged by the opposition and other senate riff-raff. Third, that in spite of this relentless blocking, the budgetary repair job has somehow been done. Turns out the opposition weren't blocking terribly much. Or that the stuff they were blocking was unnecessary to fix the budget, anyway, in which case they weren't as irresponsible as we were being asked to believe.About the only thing clear about this is the dogma Abbott is urging us to accept: "Under Labor the budget was completely out of control. Under us, it's manageable". Then, in case we missed it: "we have got the budget situation from out of control, to manageable".But how? It's a strange claim to be making when you've just spent the last few weeks systematically abandoning your own least popular savings measures. The GP co-payment is gone, we think, along with the billions it was forecast to save. The government recently found unspecified millions to give back to a car industry that is already determined to leave our shores, and gave in on a pay rise for our defence force personnel it had so long resisted. Now, the government's plans for deregulation of university fees, which would allow it to pocket further billions in education costs, lie unambiguously in tatters.  Ask the government what it has achieved, and the answer will focus on the abolition of the carbon and mining taxes, both of which cost money, the former, billions. Beyond that, there's not much left of its first term agenda. So much has now been shed that we're in the process of performing the budget's last rites. When that is complete, it will have left behind few survivors, and the funeral will have cost something in the order of $30 billion. At what point, exactly, did all that become manageable?Meanwhile, our economic growth is modest, our unemployment is high, our interest rates are already very low (meaning we can't stimulate growth very much by cutting them) and the stuff we've been selling to China keeps getting cheaper and less profitable. That's not the government's fault. But it is now the government's problem, because all this means it's about to collect a whole lot less tax. In the midst of all this, Abbott's talking up plans for childcare and small business in the next budget. This, it seems, is code for some kind of tax cut, and a sizeable chunk of spending to make childcare more affordable. All this might be cracking, politically-friendly policy, but it's also potentially some pretty hefty spending. And for all that, there's no guarantee this will achieve the political miracle Abbott is seeking. If you believe, as several cabinet ministers apparently do, that last year's budget failed because it had no narrative to explain it, then that raises a thorny question: what is the narrative of this one? "Dull" isn't quite a narrative. "Job done" simply isn't believable. "Jobs and growth" might explain any spending and tax cuts, but that would be a very Labor narrative that would require us to forget all the politics of the past six years and decide that budget deficits really aren't big a deal.  Abbott has so snookered himself that whether he increases the deficit or reduces it, he is inviting the opposition to lash him. What he needs is a way to reduce the deficit without resorting to further cuts he simply cannot sell. And anything that smells remotely like a cut will be scoured for the whiff of offensiveness.That leaves him with only one option. Make this a budget about the wealthy. It's not entirely true that the last budget had no narrative - in fact it had a very coherent one. The trouble was that it was the budget's opponents that supplied it: a budget about hitting those who could least afford it. That's a question of values, of fairness. It's why the government is still unpopular despite having dropped just about all the policies that made it so. There's an overarching objection to the spirit of the last budget. The next one needs to redress that. It needs to make a statement. It needs, say, two big policy items that raise money off the wealthy rather than the poor.It's a risk, to be sure. It clearly violates Abbott's own instincts, and risks offending his government's last remaining friends in the electorate. But it's equally clear that neither those instincts, nor those friends have saved him this far. Perhaps it's time for something bold, unexpected, suggesting bright renewal. And these, I fear, are all antonyms of dull.
**********Bomb Islamic State: is that our only strategy?********March 6, 2015******193**** Death cult. There's a certain catharsis in saying it, isn't there? Somehow, when you're confronted with the jawdropping atrocities Islamic State churns out with gruesome frequency, "terrorist" seems puny, unsatisfactory. We're looking for something that distils our rage and drips with disdain. So, death cult: it implies a kind of unhinged violence directed to no rational purpose; a group beyond comprehension that appeals only to those on the limits of sanity. So, for instance, when three young Englishwomen skip the country to join, we have no explanation other than that they were brainwashed, or that their decision, in Julie Bishop's phrase, "defies logic". That, after all, is the nature of cults.If only it were true. If only IS were a small, tightly controlled group under the command of a single charismatic leader on whom everything depends. If only it were destined to go the way of so many cults, burning destructively but briefly before disappearing with little trace in some tragic implosion. But it isn't. It's an expanding group forged in the collapsing politics of the Middle East. IS's plain barbarism shouldn't obscure this fact. Its existence is not harebrained. It is deeply political, and those who support, or even merely tolerate it, have political reasons for their decisions.Which brings me to Tony Abbott's announcement this week that we'd be sending another tranche of troops to Iraq in our ever-expanding military campaign. They'll be the latest soldiers trying valiantly to train the Iraqi Army. In some ways, there's less to this than meets the eye. We already have troops in Iraq doing this job, and it reflects precisely the strategy we're pursuing against IS: bombard them from the air and get local groups – including the Iraqi Army – to fight them on the ground. Once you've committed to that, there's nothing particularly controversial about increasing troop numbers doing the job. The trouble, though, is that it seems to be the only card we have to play. Outraged by IS, we'll send soldiers. Concerned they aren't retreating in the way we'd like, we'll send more. That, it seems, is the strategy.But we've been failing at this strategy for nearly a dozen years. America spent something like $US40 billion on the task. Soon, it became a NATO project. Naturally, Australia helped out. So did Jordan, South Korea and Romania. Iran, too, struck similar deals with the Iraqi government. And more than a decade of multi-national training later, Iraqi soldiers in Mosul simply abandoned their posts when IS rolled into town last year. Precisely why we think a few hundred extra Australian soldiers will succeed where years of grander, more expensive efforts so miserably failed, remains unexplained.But the bigger problem is that the approach remains a narrow military one. It has no obvious political dimension to it: no clearly explained account of why IS has grown so rapidly, how it took major Iraqi cities with so little resistance, and why it might prove so difficult to dislodge. But it is precisely these things that have the most to teach us. It's easy to forget that IS is scarcely the unstoppable force of our nightmares. It spread through the Sunni areas of Syria and northern Iraq mainly because no one in those regions particularly wanted to stand in their way. That included the Iraqi military, whose Sunni representatives clearly had little fidelity to the Iraqi cause. In brief, IS succeeded because it carried more good will in the regions it conquered than the Iraqi state. Not because Iraqi Sunnis are blood-loving nihilists – indeed, it was the Iraqi Sunnis who  had expelled IS's predecessor organisation, al-Qaeda in Iraq. It is rather a story of just how rent Iraq truly is; just how colossal a failure its reconstruction after we invaded it has been. And it is a story of monstrous Sunni resentment at the pro-Shiite excesses of the Iraqi state. Perhaps our greatest mistake in this regard was to disband Saddam Hussein's military machine entirely, letting it become instead the largely incompetent, Shiite-dominated muscle for an increasingly Shiite-supremacist nation under Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. With the Americans gone, Sunni protests were violently quashed, Sunni politicians hounded from office and Shiite death squads marauded far too freely. This, we watched from afar, apparently unmoved by the fact that Iraqi Sunnis were now looking for someone – anyone – prepared to stand up for them. While we were watching, IS made that offer.What's our counter offer?  Because if we're serious about defeating IS, we'll have to do more than train an Iraqi military widely regarded by Iraqi Sunnis as a tool of Shiite oppression. We'll have to find a way to win over the Sunni tribes of northern Iraq with a political future they can believe in; a future that just might inspire them to turn on IS the way they turned on al-Qaeda in Iraq. That means a more inclusive Iraqi state, and on this score Iraq's new Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is making some positive noises. We're also helped considerably by the astonishing scale of IS's barbarism, which is causing many Sunnis living under its regime de la terreur a severe case of buyer's remorse. But if our only plan is to bomb IS into history, we might just lose these advantages.  We also might leave something worse in its place, just as IS took the place of al-Qaeda after we'd tried bombing them. The question we face now is not as simple as: more or less war? It is: what else? What's our political strategy?  And I'm not sure the death cult paradigm delivers us an answer.
**********Fuse lit with rhetorical bomb about Indonesia********February 20, 2015******506**** So, this is what it looks like when you outsource your foreign policy to Alan Jones. "You do what you like, but we gave you a billion dollars when you were hit by the tsunami," he boomed recently on Q&A, his message directed squarely at the Indonesian President, who had rejected Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran's death-row pleas to have their lives spared. I'm with Jones on the cause. Very rarely would an execution be more needless than in this apparently inevitable case. Rarely have we seen better cases of demonstrated remorse and rehabilitation. But to use aid – for a disaster in which more than 100,000 Indonesians died – as leverage? That's taking us to dark places.Perhaps it was a fit of frustration that led Tony Abbott down precisely this path. After every effort the government has made, that frustration would be understandable. Perhaps Abbott calculated that the cause was so utterly hopeless that he had given up entirely on convincing the Indonesians to relent, and chose instead to play to his domestic audience. Or perhaps Abbott didn't grasp the gravity of suggesting that Indonesia "reciprocate" for our aid with clemency. But that's the problem. Abbott isn't running talkback. He's running international diplomacy. And in that world of maddeningly polite, highly coded speech, this is a rhetorical bomb. It says our aid is conditional, that it imposes obligations and that if we feel those obligations haven't been met, we might just withhold it in future. That's a hell of thing to imply, even in private.  Especially when you're a country currently slashing foreign aid, and already hugely outspent by countries like China.  But said in public, it's a wealthy country with far less leverage than it thinks trying to lord it over a developing one.Hence Indonesia's extraordinary diplomatic serve: "no one responds well to threats," declared a spokesman for the foreign ministry, which sounds ominously like a diplomat's way of saying "you've just blown it". It's a particularly sharp response that reveals a particularly sharp sensitivity. Partly this is about the politics of drug smuggling in Indonesia.  Every nation has its irrational belligerences; its issues where the politics dictate it is impossible to be too tough, where compassion is recast as weakness, and weakness is unforgivable. For us, it's probably boat people. For Indonesia, it's probably drugs. And when that's the political logic, the very last thing you can be seen to be doing is capitulating before a threat. "If you need something from somebody always give that person a way to hand it to you," advises one of Sue Monk Kidd's characters in The Secret Life of Bees. That is precisely what our tsunami aid manoeuvre has denied Indonesia.But this stand-off is also about something bigger. Perhaps the most alarming aspect of Indonesia's response is its allegation that "people will show their true colours": that our "threats" are not an isolated faux pas, but reveal something deeply characteristic about us as a nation. That through Indonesian eyes, this is all part of a broader pattern of objectionable behaviour. Those objections are well rehearsed: we treat Indonesia's sovereignty with contempt, ignore their cries of offence, and then feel entitled to order them to do our bidding. It's at moments like these that such Indonesian grievances come home to roost.Some of this tension is ancient: our support for East Timorese independence is scarcely forgotten, and fuels a long-standing fear we want to break chunks off Indonesia's territory. But much of it is recent, too. Some of this is transient – as with Indonesia's anger over the Gillard government's snap suspension over the live cattle trade. Other objections are more enduring, as with our asylum-seeker boats turnback policy – an objection only amplified when it became clear Australian naval vessels had crossed, unauthorised, into Indonesian waters. It's the kind of thing we forget and dismiss, but to a nation like Indonesia with a weak navy and a gigantic coastline to defend, it feels like a serious violation of its borders. Meanwhile, both sides of politics have long demanded Indonesia crack down on people smuggling in a way that barely acknowledges that the asylum seekers there don't want to stay, and Indonesia doesn't want to keep them. That makes it far more our problem than theirs, but one we've insisted they solve. We got a sense of the level of tension this causes when Indonesia decided to release the transcript of conversations between both countries' foreign ministers in which Julie Bishop asked for asylum-seeker issues to be kept "behind the scenes". This was a clear, angry attempt to embarrass Australia.Then, of course, there were the revelations the Rudd government had tapped the phones of the Indonesian president and his wife. Indonesia swiftly demanded an apology, to which the new Abbott government responded by refusing even to acknowledge the practice, much less pledge it would be abandoned. Abbott defended Australia's "intelligence gathering" as "reasonable", and Indonesia recalled its ambassador and temporarily withdrew all co-operation on people smuggling. Meanwhile, perhaps for colour, the government's pollster, Mark Textor, likened the Indonesian foreign minister to a "1970s Filipino porn star" and upon learning of Indonesia's offence throughout the episode, tweeted that "no-one gives a rat's arse in the real world".Well, it's all pretty real now. Sure, hope is eternal, but we're at the point of hoping for a miracle. Perhaps it was always destined to be this way. I'm certainly not blaming the Australian government for Chan's and Sukumaran's plight, and such is Indonesia's dogmatism on this that there's every chance the result would be the same, however pristine the relationship. But whatever the case, the final exchanges of this tragedy have revealed something worth pondering: our relationship with Indonesia is in a state of disrepair.  And in that relationship, there will surely come times when plenty of us will give whatever part of the rat you care to name.
**********Coalition needs a heart transplant, not a facelift********February 6, 2015******328**** It's the repetition that gets me.  How precisely every Coalition minister presently denying there is any reality to the current bout of leadership speculation sounds like Gillard's ministers in 2013. How assuredly the unstoppable backbench revolt makes a mockery of these denials.  How Abbott now, like Gillard then, pleads with us to focus on policies rather than personalities – as though we've all just simultaneously decided, completely unprompted, that we'd rather our politics took the form of glossy magazines.But there's one inescapably large problem with this plea: the government's in trouble precisely because we have been focussing on policy. That was true for Labor, whose collapse in public support occurred the moment Kevin Rudd decided he no longer thought climate change mattered that much, and it is perhaps even truer for Abbott. In time, his first budget will become legend for the sheer breadth of its political self-destruction. It's not that the electorate didn't understand the suite of policies, or was distracted by personality politics. It's not that it was poorly explained (though on several levels, it was).  It's that the electorate grasped the underlying values of the government's maiden offering, and found it repugnant. It still does.That is perhaps the most significant unifying factor between the Liberal National disaster in Queensland and the one now unfolding in Canberra.  All the arguments about "federal vs state" factors overlook that these were perhaps the two most similar governments in Australia. Both debuted with monstrous budgets that showed a penchant for austerity politics. Both attacked the public service and declared an unshakeable love for privatisation. Both hacked into health. And both did so without declaring their intentions to the people who had just elected them. The problem is that both ran into the ideological limits of the electorate: limits they simply assumed didn't exist.So if it is to be leadership change for Abbott, what then? It's a far more important question than the one about whether or not a spill is coming in the first place. To see this, let's return to Labor's sorry experience. "What then?" is precisely the question Labor could never ultimately answer, and which ultimately condemned it to ignominy. Recall Bill Shorten's revealing admission in 2013 that he would vote for Gillard's demise, and Rudd's return, as a way of protecting Gillard's legacy. He would deliver us a new King, but in the service of his vanquished predecessor. A predecessor Shorten would slay so she might live.Got that? It's a frank admission that Labor's last coup was merely cosmetic: a facelift, not a heart transplant. There was no policy difference to note and no party renewal to spruik. Having been implored to overcome our shallow obsession with personality, we discovered that this seems to have been Labor's obsession, too.  And of course, it failed.That doesn't mean policy was irrelevant. Indeed Labor's problems arose partly because its policy was incoherent. Gillard's carbon tax disaster occurred only because she was so desperate to avoid a proper climate change policy that she went to the election proposing a citizens' assembly that would somehow devise her policy for her. "No carbon tax" was what you said when you had nothing serious to say. It was this policy vacuum that drew her into the broken promise  from which she never recovered. From there, the personalities took over, and Gillard was simply in too weak a position to withstand Rudd's incessant blows.Whatever happens now, the Coalition cannot afford to be seduced by such facelifts. That is not to say it should rule out a coup: of all the people praying for Abbott's survival, a goodly portion of them will be in the Labor party. But it is to say that if the government does opt for a new head, it must also seek a new heart. And here, the Coalition has one meaningful advantage. Abbott's public critics – from Dennis Jensen and Mal Brough to Andrew Laming – are mounting their attacks on clear policy bases. They're criticising Medicare co-payments and defence force pay. They're charging that the policy settings are inconsistent. In short, they're siding against unpopular policy and specifying the very problems they'd expect a new leader to fix. Abbott, of course, can do nothing about them, partly because it is not in his nature to admit policy mistakes, and partly because any change of direction from him will quickly be dismissed as cynical politicking. But a new leader would have at least a crude blueprint for renewal.Which is a start. But at this point, it's also not quite enough. The Coalition needs something bigger, and more fundamental than some policy tweaks. If Abbott has a successor, that person has to give this government a clear, agreeable organising principle. In short, it needs a narrative. It needs an overarching story of the world that makes sense of the pain we're being asked to wear. It needs to tell us not merely why it wants to charge people more for GP visits, but rather the grander philosophical basis on which it decides who should bear the costs of reform. It needs this because that is precisely the charge against it. Not that it's made tough decisions, but that it has made discriminatory and cruel ones. That its philosophy of pain is simply that it should be visited upon people it doesn't like: poor people, sick people, young people. Despite all the words it has ever said in its defence, the government has never clearly answered that charge. Even now, as Abbott seeks some miraculous reset and his supporters insist there's nothing to see here except a government listening and improving, it's a charge that still goes unanswered. At some point, though, the Coalition will have to engage with this. And as long as it doesn't, it makes not a jot of difference who's leader.
**********Plane crashes, terrorism, random violence - new realities amid our relative security********January 8, 2015******450**** Is this just normal now? That's perhaps the most disturbing thought I had as news of another terrorist attack, this time in Paris, broke. Somehow this has begun to look familiar, like an episode in a show we've seen before. The feeling is familiar too: when you awake to something catastrophic, unprecedented and unthinkable – or so you thought.  This feeling, more than anything, seems to have defined the past year; a year that, by apparent consensus, was positively, gallingly crappy. It's not just terrorism – to which I'll return, soon – it's everything. It's the feeling I had as watching the debris and dead bodies from that AirAisa flight being retrieved, it was like witnessing a ghoulish symbolic performance of a year in review. Little symbolises the unique squalor of 2014 like the bizarrely tragic year in aviation. Surely the worst ever.Except that it wasn't. Not by a long shot. "By numbers – the safest year in modern aviation history," trumpeted the Aviation Safety Network.  That might be hard to take as you contemplate the sorry fate of Malaysia Airlines and its passengers. But there it is: only eight planes crashed in 2014. That's three fewer than the previous best, a couple of years ago. And this in an age when there are more planes in the air than ever before. Really, it was a relative triumph. Do the statistics lie?Well, yeah, a bit. But not shamelessly. Judged by numbers of deaths, rather than crashes, 2014 is the worst year since the late '90s. Even so 2014 was still better than almost every year before that going back to 1960. Plot them on a graph and last year doesn't disturb the general downward trend. Turns out it doesn't look as out of place as it felt.That sort of thing happened quite bit last year. That's not to deny that it was objectively terrible in many ways, often in the ways we didn't feel so keenly. There is no silver lining I can find to 7000 Ebola deaths, for instance, even if this seemed to lack the emotional kick of Phillip Hughes'. But it's also true that the things that angered, depressed and panicked us were less than they appeared.We began with Daniel Christie, whose brief 2014 was spent entirely in a coma until his family ended life support after a few days. One punch, a fractured skull, then death. The facts are so arresting precisely because they are so simple and so few. And so, in a flash came the media coverage, the political responses and the public awareness campaigns. The "king hit" became the "coward's punch", and whatever it was called it became the target of a new criminal offence. Sentencing became mandatory. Venues had lockouts and new, enforced closing times. We had been provoked by a new and growing scourge. Australia had a major drinking problem, and with it a marauding violence problem, and Christie was the face of it.And yet. The statistical truth is that we're drinking less than we were around the time Kevin Rudd ousted John Howard, and massively less than we did in the '70s and '80s when, apparently, we were perpetually tanked. Violence on licensed premises is dropping, too, and so are alcohol-related assaults. We're even going to hospital less for alcohol-related reasons. And this with a growing population.Of course, none of that helps the Christies. And – to be sure – none of it means there isn't a serious problem we've been ignoring for too long. But there is something to learn from the way a problem can suddenly become a panic.So back to terrorism, that other definitive blight on last year, and given the tragic events in Paris, quite probably this one. The frightening emergence of ISIS abroad, then in a more symbolic form at home tell us this is no mere illusion. We witnessed the first domestic casualties of Islamist terrorism we've had. This all has a vaguely apocalyptic feel, and yet when more than 20 Australian soldiers were killed in Afghanistan in 2010-11 it hardly gave us pause. That just felt normal. So we performed the customary ceremonies and moved on to worrying about the carbon tax which, by contrast, seemed to scare the pants of us.Here's the thing: in our streets, in our bank accounts and in the air, we in Australia lead about the safest, most secure lives of any people. Ever. Our real income is up and the road toll is down (the lowest since 1945, by the way). We live without any genuine prospect of political strife. We're not about to be invaded or bombed with nuclear weapons – our most feared enemies have knives and guns, not armies in tanks. We're not likely to be decimated by some disease or virus – Ebola or otherwise. Yes we have problems, but they're the kind most of our species could only have dreamed of having. And yet that's so easy to forget because there's this continuous, churning fear.Our mortal selves aren't under threat, here. But the myths we've built about ourselves very much are. The myth that our addiction to alcohol is innocently, endearingly larrikin, for example. Or that the problems of the world – like Russia's incursion into Ukraine or the disaster of Iraq and Syria – have no call on us and simply don't raise their heads in Sydney or Paris. Indeed the myth – that incidentally underscores how cheerfully we'll slash foreign aid – that we can set ourselves apart as (largely uninterested) onlookers: that the world is a sideshow to which we'll occasionally buy a ticket, but not our society.Maybe we don't realise it yet, but 2014 might just be the year those myths died. That, I think, is why it hurts and shocks so much. This is as painful a process for a society as losing people. It's not just that people perished and dangers emerged. It's that those deaths and dangers weren't meant to happen. Not to us. And I can't find any statistics that can remove that feeling.
**********Sydney gunman Man Haron Monis a real sheikh only to himself********December 17, 2014******568**** We can't stop this.  Sorry, but we can't.  As we ruminate on a thousand hows and what ifs – such as how the hell did someone like Man Haron Monis find himself out on bail – there's a brutal truth we can't escape: we're trying to impose order on chaos; to convince ourselves that everything can some day be under our control, when it just can't.  Tony Abbott deserves lasting admiration for having the courage to admit as much.From all appearances, this was as crude and as solitary as it gets.  There's no high-tech wizardry on show.  There's no elaborate, maniacal plan worthy of a Hollywood supervillain.  There's not even a mastermind pulling strings to make this more coherent.  There is only a man, a gun and a flag.  The man and the gun we've seen before.  Indeed, we've seen it horrifically often: in Belgium just hours after Martin Place; at Port Arthur.  But the flag – that changes things.  It lends this the apocalyptic timbre that drives us so mad.  It's the thing in this episode that does the least damage – and the most.It's also the thing that makes this global.  There's every reason to suspect we're dealing with someone deranged here but many deranged gunmen have gone before him.  Only rarely do they associate themselves with the symbolic power of a global militant movement.  At no point in the history of our species have such human satellites, living beyond the margins of even the most marginal groups, had the power to do so: the power to become so much more than they are simply by attaching themselves to a symbol from another continent.  And right now, there is no symbol more potent and available than that of Islamic terrorism.So, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau and Martin Rouleau Couture in Canada.  Zale Thompson in New York.  Now Monis at Martin Place.  We're seeing this more now: troubled (often criminal) histories, possible mental illness, religious conversion, violence.  Monis apparently converted to Sunni Islam only recently, perhaps because you can't really claim to love IS when you're a Shiite and they're trying to exterminate you.  Islam has such permeable borders, such an absence of hierarchy, that anyone can become anything in their own mind.  Its symbols are available to anyone who wants to claim them and there is nothing anyone can do to stop them.  Australian Muslims had been disowning Monis for at least seven years.  They'd even expressed their concerns to the authorities.  But how can you stop the "fake sheikh" being real to himself?There's no control order regime to account for this.  There's no metadata inside an apparently deranged mind.  We're busy fretting about the terrorists' tools of the future – which is all fair enough – while they wreak havoc with the tools of the past.  Think about what we've seen lately, from Australia to North America: a knife, an axe, a couple of guns, even a car.  Perhaps the most profound aspect of our age is that the power to inflict carnage is now shared with the small to the invisible to the otherwise insignificant.  Man Haron Monis was so insignificant, hardly anyone knew him; so insignificant the system overlooked him.  And now he's history.But there's another history to be written here.  One that is very much in control.  It's a history written not just in the statements of leaders, but in the minutiae of our everyday interactions.  It's the history we glimpsed as the siege unfolded when a single, humble Australian decided to declare #illridewithyou in solidarity with Muslims too scared to ride public transport.  It's a history that commenced with the interfaith vigil held at the Lakemba and Auburn mosques.  And it's a history to be determined by what we decide this tragedy symbolises: the sordid ideology of a man who deserves to be forgotten or the greatest virtues of those of us left behind.
