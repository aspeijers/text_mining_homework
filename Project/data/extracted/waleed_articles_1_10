**********Ray Rice case the tip of an ugly NFL iceberg********September 19, 2014******0**** The Californian newspaper U-T San Diego has compiled an NFL Arrests Database.  It only goes back to 2000, but comprises 727 entries.  It's serious stuff, too: assaulting police officers, violent child abuse, felony domestic violence and  drug possession.  And that's just in the past six weeks. Ray Rice, incidentally, isn't one of these.  He's just the one you've heard about since TMZ released the sickening video of him brutally knocking his then fiance unconscious in an elevator, then dragging her limp body out of view.  That incident is from February – entry No. 32.  Now think about that: 31 players have been arrested since then. Now, the NFL's cover is blown: the rampant, frequently criminal violence of its players; the protection racket that surrounds the most talented stars; the culture of denial that sees someone like Rice pitifully suspended for only two matches until the full video becomes public and shames the sport into action.  And it's far from an isolated case.  To get a sense of how manifestly absurd it gets, consider that in covering the Ray Rice disaster, ESPN relied on an ex-teammate and mentor named Ray Lewis. He  is a suspect in a double homicide and has admitted to hindering the investigation. But for all that, the NFL is far and away the dominant American sport. It might even be the dominant American thing.  It rates like nothing else on US television, setting new audience records year after year.  It's a multi-billion dollar business: the Dallas Cowboys are worth more than  $3 billion alone.  Can sport really be that indestructible?  Can we be so helplessly intoxicated by it that even when a  number of its stars are felons, we simply shrug and move on?  To date, the answer is yes.  The very magic of sport is that it manages, somehow, to persuade us that it is anything more than utterly trivial.  This, quite clearly, is a product of its unadulterated escapism.  Sport is a parallel world that offers all the things the rest of life doesn't: sharply defined social groupings, delineated by unambiguous tribal colouring; an indisputable, final result; the promise of a meritocracy.  This is adult make believe; a neatly contained environment in which nothing else matters – especially not anything that really matters. That apparently includes almost any of the players' vices.  More so than any of our public figures, our athletes are not people.  Politicians may strike us as caricatures, pop stars and actors may be doused in layers of fakery, but they all build their success on at least the illusion of being human.  Singers bare their soul by singing about their latest heartbreak; the actor draws on emotions we all understand in order to make us relate to their character; the politician searches endlessly for a common touch that places them among us (perhaps by feigning an interest in sport).  The trick is to make us think we know them as people, even as we don't.  But the athlete?  There is simply no such requirement.  The athlete is defined by the colour of their guernsey, their deeds on the field and little else.  So we boo them instantly the moment those colours change. Sport is an utterly self-referential world.  Extrinsic facts are of limited value.  Only intrinsic scandals are truly scandalous.  So we barely discuss that, for example, two AFL players (one recently retired) are presently facing rape charges.  We are far more likely to be rocked by allegations of systematic doping, or match fixing.  None of this is as serious as rape in any serious worldview.  But sport is precisely about the suspension of a serious worldview.  A player's alleged rape seems to belong to a separate world we can quarantine and leave in the hands of the justice system.  But a player's use of performance enhancing drugs violates this world and for that reason becomes intolerable.  So, for all the well-established thuggery of so many NFL stars, it has never lost its grip on the American imagination in the way baseball did in the '90s. First the players went on strike and then found themselves embroiled in a drugs scandal. Here's hoping Rice's misogynist brutality is enough to make worlds collide.  Here's hoping it will finally be perhaps the first extrinsic scandal that is so heinous, so suffocating, that it becomes an intrinsic, inseparable part of the way we talk about the game.  Only this can force the NFL to understand the severity of its failings and force sport more generally, to understand its moral obligations.  Sport may be escapism, but it has an extraordinary power to teach and to lead society, to bring together people who would otherwise never interact.  To do this, though, it must understand the expectations of the society it's in.  If sport is to be our uncritically loved parallel world, it must prove itself worthy of the privilege.  Right now, the NFL isn't.
**********Ukraine the latest pawn in an imperial game********March 21, 2014******0**** Seems the good people of Sevastopol really want to be Russian. All 123 per cent of them turned out to vote in this week's referendum to say so. They're a fickle bunch, though.If they're anything like their fellow Crimeans, only about a third of them felt this way in 2011, and only a quarter still did in 2013. This week it's in the vicinity of 97 per cent. That's some turnaround, even if you allow for the fact that there was a mass boycott from anti-Russian residents, or that people armed with only a Russian passport were allowed to vote.So Crimea is now part of Russia - at least if you ask Vladimir Putin who cheerfully annexed the peninsula in response. The West, of course, is apoplectic, branding all this illegal and imposing sanctions on Russia. And indeed, on one reading, this is uniquely egregious.Not since World War II has anyone in Europe simply taken territory from a sovereign country. Russia has its pretexts - chief among them that the ethnic Russian population in Ukraine is facing persecution - but none of them lead legitimately to swallowing another nation's land. Especially not after a dodgy referendum that gave voters a choice only between joining Russia and effective autonomy. If you wanted to vote to remain part of Ukraine, subordinate to Kiev, you simply had no box to tick.The hypocrisy here is profound. When Kosovo held a referendum in 2008 to declare its independence from Serbia, the apoplexy was all Russia's. It didn't matter that this followed nine years of negotiations, during which time Kosovo was under international supervision.It didn't matter that the Kosovar people had endured dozens of massacres at Serbian hands as part of a dedicated ethnic cleansing campaign - a level of persecution that renders any comparison with the experience of Russian-speakers in Ukraine simply ridiculous.Russia screamed this violated Serbia's territorial integrity and that the United Nations was therefore obliged to declare the referendum void and impose ''severe administrative measures'' against Kosovar institutions. It's the same story Russia always tells, no matter how wretched the circumstances (see Syria).In the Russian view, a nation should be free to persecute as many of its own people as it pleases without having to deal with foreign interference.Sovereignty trumps all.Listen closely to Putin's words back in 2008: ''The precedent of Kosovo is a terrible precedent, which will de facto blow apart the whole system of international relations, developed not over decades, but over centuries.'' Heavy stuff.Now it seems it's a precedent he's only too happy to follow, with interest. Putin's rhetoric must therefore return to condemn him: he is not merely undermining Ukraine, or Western interests; he's undermining the entire international system. Any way you cut it, Putin is adopting a decidedly imperial pose.All of which would be scandalous if it weren't so common. The most tin-eared, self-unaware comment of this episode must still surely be US Secretary of State John Kerry's insistence that ''you just don't in the 21st century behave in 19th-century fashion by invading another country on completely trumped-up pretext''.Of course, this is perhaps the most eloquent description of America's 21st-century invasion of Iraq that anyone has yet offered. Certainly, Iraq and Crimea are not identical. The biggest difference (aside from the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilian deaths) is that America was never going to annex Iraq. That is no longer America's style.But it would be naive to stop there; to accept at face value the suggestion that America therefore has no imperial impulses and operates as a modest nation-state, concerned merely with the administration of its own territory. The age of empire may formally have passed, but that just means today's empires take a different form.Now they expand interests and project power through non-military means. They prop up compliant, unpopular, frequently dictatorial allies through copious aid. Elsewhere they fund civil society groups that non-allied governments regard as hostile. They build military and economic alliances with countries they feel a strategic need to have on their side.Ukraine is precisely such a country. Indeed, so are several of the former-Soviet states that sit between Russia and Europe.This is why America has been so keen to bring them into NATO, thereby forging a military pact with them - the kind that was mobilised to pound Serbia in 1999.Russia fears the same thing could happen to it if NATO incorporates too many countries that sit on its borders. Russia openly regards this as an existential threat.So far NATO has coaxed Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. In time it hoped to add Georgia and Ukraine, thereby surrounding Russia. There's nothing random about America's designs here. And there's nothing random about Russia's determination to stop it, and expand its own alliances in Eurasia. This is an imperial game.''I prefer Russia,'' says Sean Connery's character in The Russia House. ''It's as corrupt as America, but there's less bullshit.'' That's about the size of it.When circumstances demand it, neither power cares much for the niceties of international law, and neither is meaningfully bound by it. Both aim to project their power as far as possible. But America's form of empire building is generally sophisticated enough to retain the veneer of normal international relations. Russia just goes ahead and annexes stuff.
**********Coalition finds ideology, but does it have a vision?********March 7, 2014******0**** We're beginning to run a touch low on icons. With Holden's demise now official, the focus has this week shifted to Qantas, which is so comprehensively stuffed that its strategy is to approach the government for an unsecured loan of $3 billion.That, of course, was fanciful. Just how fanciful becomes clear when you consider that the Abbott government has now ruled out even providing a debt guarantee, which at least in the short term involves handing no money over at all. In fact, the government's only plan for Qantas seems to be to propose legislation it has no hope of passing, which would allow it to seek greater foreign investment.''No Plan B'' screams the opposition. True enough, I suppose. But let us not be lured into thinking this points to a government with no ideas and no imagination. This absence of a plan here is something studied and deliberate. The Abbott government has a plan to have no plan, and it's really committed to it.That's the whole point of neo-liberalism. It sees the world as a market and solves every problem through it. In this scheme, governments exist to keep the market running, not to develop elaborate plans for companies or industries. Thus the Abbott government's response to the Qantas disaster is an entirely predictable one for a neo-liberal government to offer: remove as many market distortions as possible, then do nothing else.To be sure, the government hasn't been pristine on this. Just last week it gave money and access to favourable loans to drought-stricken farmers. Last year it blocked foreign investment in GrainCorp. And of course there was the now infamous grant it pledged to Cadbury before the election. Indeed there are still plenty of small business grants being given.But politics is always compromised to some degree, and the political imperatives in such cases are typically clear, focused as they are on winning marginal seats or placating the National Party. It's on the big cases that the government has been determined to make a statement.So with Qantas as with Holden, Toyota and SPC Ardmona, the government is doing more than making policy decisions. It is articulating a philosophy. Plenty of people hate it, but that only proves that it's unmistakable.Ideas, it seems, are back in Australian politics. In just six months in office, the Abbott government has discovered a level of philosophical clarity Labor couldn't manage in six years.This is a remarkable thing for a Coalition whose approach to opposition had almost nothing to do with ideology. Abbott's promiscuous opportunism delivered his party government, but also the fear that his would be a government with no direction. So much for that.The problem is that we don't really know where this road ends. The almost total absence of ideological contest in the past two elections has meant that we've never really debated this. At no point has the Coalition had to explain what its Australia would look like in, say, 30 years. What do we think our economy will look like, for instance?As so many traditional jobs and iconic companies pass into history, you might think it an urgent question. But the Coalition feels no need to answer it because neo-liberalism asks us to trust that the market will simply produce more efficient replacement jobs. No plan, remember? That's the plan.It's a lot of trust to place in a theory. And even if it works, it means a great deal of pain along the way for a great many people. This is what Labor is most keen to exploit. But even so, it has hardly unleashed the kind of withering attack that leaves the nation's ears ringing. A government surrounded by enough bad news to have it in serious trouble still has its head above water.That's because the government has managed to weave much of this bad news into a story. Its decisions are comprehensible, even if you instinctively detest them; coherent, even if galling. This is more or less the opposite of what Labor achieved in government, where, for example, it neglected its story on climate change to such an extent that by the time the carbon tax arrived it was discussed almost entirely in economic terms, and viewed through the prism of political dishonesty.The result is that Labor can't so easily adopt the Abbott approach to opposition, which was to throw whichever punches were in reach, create a sense of chaos and declare the government illegitimate. Abbott could do that because Labor's narrative was never particularly clear, so it didn't need a more comprehensive or consistent riposte.By contrast, this government's stand against corporate support is easily grasped, and stands as a broad guiding principle. Labor needs a counter-narrative of its own that the Coalition can't just dismiss as propping up failing businesses, but it's far from clear what that is.This reflects what is perhaps the biggest difference between the way the major parties do politics. Labor in power attempts to prove itself on the Coalition's terms (hence the obsessive and ultimately futile quest for a surplus). The Coalition simply pays no heed to Labor. That's what happens when only one side has clear ideological zeal. And so we have ideas in politics again. What we lack is an ideological contest.
**********The real reason behind Tony Abbott's industrial relations war********February 7, 2014******0**** Liberal backbencher Sharman Stone is the most effective opposition leader in the country. She's across her brief, argues her case powerfully and directly, and carries with her an undeniable sincerity that spectacularly subordinates her prospects of career advancement to the interests of her constituents.But perhaps most profoundly, she has managed in the space of a week to surround the Abbott government with a series of intractable questions that drive at the heart of exactly what this hitherto opaque government is really trying to achieve. Stone is making the government transparent.To be clear, she almost certainly does not intend anything so grand. Her aim is simply to reverse her colleagues' decision to deny SPC Ardmona the $25 million it apparently needs to keep operating. But when you accuse your own boss of "lying" and "hypocrisy", and when you lay bare the political imperatives of making election promises to marginal seats that contradict the decisions you make in safe ones, you inevitably open a vein. This is no longer just about whether or not the government's decision was justified. It's about why the government has chosen to present this issue the way it has.Why did the Prime Minister so grossly misrepresent SPC's enterprise bargaining agreement, and the costs it imposes on the company?The government had several coherent (even if contestable) reasons for its decision: SPC sits within a highly profitable company flushed with cash to invest unlike our debt-riddled government; that to give money in these circumstances would set an appalling precedent of corporate welfare, inviting profitable businesses to queue for handouts; that this government is philosophically driven by the principle that it is for businesses to stand or fall on their own.Fleetingly, the government mentioned these. Since the storm of protest it has fallen back on them.But for what Tony Abbott has described as a "defining decision" of this government - one that underlined its firm philosophical commitment to non-intervention in the market and the end of corporate welfare - it has now significantly muddied its own waters.There was scant justification for placing industrial relations at the centre of this story. Ask SPC why it's struggling and you get a very clear answer that emphatically has nothing to do with industrial relations. Employees' allowances, they've now informed us, cost them $116,467 last year. Next to the $25 million they're after, that's piddling.In that context there was simply no need for the Prime Minister to give the company, which he had just finished telling us was so well run, public advice on how bad its industrial arrangements are.SPC knows its industrial arrangements - considerably better than the government, it turns out. No, the government's performance here was for the electorate.In this respect, the SPC decision is really chapter two.Chapter one came last week when Employment Minister Eric Abetz warned that Australia risked "something akin to a wages explosion of the pre-accord era when unsustainable wage growth simply pushed thousands of Australians out of work".As it happens, actual wage growth is the lowest we've ever seen, but Abetz wasn't talking about money. He was taking aim at conditions: too much leave and the like, which makes businesses less profitable.Abetz's evidence was thin, which is probably why economists broadly dismissed his claims. He drew on a few examples from the car manufacturing industry and the resources industry, which represent the extreme ends of our two-speed economy and not an economy-wide trend of over-generosity. But that is the portrait of our economy the government is urging on us: one where it is workers' conditions negotiated collectively with employers that cost jobs, and not the bigger underlying economic conditions like the strength of our currency or our exposure to a global marketplace that often reciprocates with more protectionist measures than we afford ourselves.The SPC case therefore had to be bent into shape to fit this narrative. That's why the government emphasised things such as the EBA's "wet allowance", which means almost nothing to anyone, and for that precise reason sounds idiosyncratic and decadently, unjustifiably generous."Wet allowance? I don't have a wet allowance. No one has a wet allowance! Must be a rort!" thought the public. Or at least it did until it became clear that this allowance covers the costs of protective gear for people whose job brings them into contact with dangerous chemicals, and that SPC no longer pays it anyway, preferring instead to buy the gear for the workers itself.Significantly, this narrative isn't simply one of union bashing. Listen to Abbott and Abetz and you'll note the companies are getting bashed as well. They're the ones Abetz described as "weak-kneed", and which Abbott has urged to get their "house in order". What's happening here is a transference of responsibility: a declaration that our industrial relations are in total disrepair, but that it's not for the government to do anything about it.This, I suspect, is the Abbott government's way of establishing an industrial relations conversation, without having a policy debate on the issue. Abbott knows any discussion of policy will be politically catastrophic. He also faces enormous pressure from within his own movement to take back the territory the Coalition surrendered with John Howard's defeat.The solution seems to be to make it an issue independent of government; to illustrate slowly over time that the system is broken so that reform becomes possible.It's as though Abbott is trying to drag himself kicking and screaming towards a policy. But to do that his illustrations need to have punch. And all that is lost when your illustrations turn out to be caricatures.
**********Unravelling the Turkish enigma********January 24, 2014******0**** Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is perhaps the most intriguing, enigmatic world leader of his generation. His legacy will almost certainly be an utterly transformed Turkey, no longer dominated by the military and clearly having shed the aggressive secularism Ataturk so famously set in train nearly a century ago. And yet, no one can say for sure what his agenda is without resorting ultimately to ideologically driven portraits. Never has such an activist politician been so difficult to grasp.Is he an arch-Islamist autocrat, determined to force Islamic mores on unwilling Turks? Or is he an exemplar of Islam's marriage with democracy; a reformer who has established civilian rule, expanded civil rights and handed cultural rights to the oppressed Kurdish minority?The truth is it's a confusing picture. His decade of democratic reforms in a frequently authoritarian nation must stand as a remarkable achievement. But last month he found his government engulfed in a monstrous corruption scandal that has claimed four ministers and resulted in more than 20 arrests. His response has been to attempt a purge of the police force and the judiciary of disloyal elements. This naturally invites strident charges of, among other things, trashing judicial independence.At the intersection of these contradictory images of Erdogan lies one enduring issue: Europe. Erdogan's democratic reforms were delivered as he pushed for Turkey's inclusion in the EU. But those negotiations have been stalled for 3½ years now, and this has roughly coincided with his more autocratic turn.Turkey has begun looking very much like it is facing east. Erdogan's party has suggested several times that it might abandon its EU bid, and instead join the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation dominated by Russia and China. Meanwhile Turkey's stance towards Israel has cooled as its relationship with Iran warms. Senior government members make frequent cultural overtures like the deputy speaker who recently criticised "pro-West" practices such as co-education.All of which makes this week utterly fascinating. For the first time in five years, Erdogan finds himself in Brussels. And for the first time in more than three, Turkey is again negotiating with Europe. If you believe that Turkey is more likely to steer in a transparent, democratic direction when it is seeking EU admission than when it is not, these talks are also very important, and offer hope that Turkey's recent authoritarian slide might be arrested.But in so many ways the timing is bizarre and disastrous. Erdogan goes to these talks in a weakened position. Europe is decidedly unimpressed by his judicial purge, for which he remains defiantly unapologetic. Meanwhile, the head of Turkey's business association is now saying the country is in danger of becoming a "police state", and perhaps most symbolically, corruption allegations have forced Erdogan to sack his EU minister. When you add the fact that Turkey has lately shown no apparent interest in joining the EU, there's a blindingly obvious question to ask about all this: do these negotiations have any hope at all?It's easy to argue they don't. In fact it's easy to argue they're a charade. The argument runs that Erdogan doesn't really need the EU any more because while European support was helpful in his agenda to establish civilian rule, that battle has now been won. Europe has rejected Turkey when it has had better democratic credentials than it does now, so how could it be remotely well disposed to Turkish accession?If that's right, it's a pity for both sides. Europe, frankly, could use a sizeable and growing economy at the moment. But that growth is now slowing, and this is where Erdogan has much to gain. EU membership would open access to European markets, perhaps giving him the injection he needs.How seriously these talks proceed will tell us much about the parties. Clearly they will help Turks decide whether Europe will ever have any intention of letting them into the club. But they'll also tell us something about how Erdogan sees the world and Turkey's place within it. And in that way, this episode might just help us understand who Erdogan is.

His democratic reforms were delivered as he pushed for Turkey's inclusion in the EU. But those negotiations have been stalled for 3½ years now, and this has roughly coincided with his more autocratic turn.Meanwhile, Turkey has begun looking very much like it is facing east - as though it had finally decided, after a century of imitating and seeking acceptance from Europe, not to bother any more. Erdogan's party has suggested several times that it might abandon its EU bid, and instead join the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation, dominated by Russia and China. Meanwhile, Turkey's stance towards Israel has cooled as its relationship with Iran is warming.

In this way, the talks allow him to draw further attention to his eastward march.Meanwhile, Europe has resolutely rejected Turkey when it has had better democratic credentials than it does now, so how could it be remotely well disposed to Turkish accession? If that's right, it's a pity for both sides. Despite all the bluster and identity politics that so often pollutes this issue, the fact is each has something to gain here. Europe, frankly, could use a sizeable and growing economy at the moment. But that growth is now slowing, and this is where Erdogan has much to gain.The truth is he's in more trouble than he'll care to admit. Only once has Erdogan gone backwards in an election - in 2009 after the financial crisis. He is more vulnerable than at any time since.EU membership would open access to European markets, perhaps giving him the injection he needs. How seriously these talks proceed will tell us much about the parties. Clearly they will help Turks decide whether Europe will ever have any intention of letting them into the club. But they'll also tell us something about how Erdogan sees the world and Turkey's home in it. And in that way, this episode might just help us understand who Erdogan is.
**********Divided Lebanon has an identity crisis********January 10, 2014******0**** The National Museum of Beirut houses one of the great prehistoric collections in the world. It's here you'll find the earliest example we have of an alphabet in human history. You'll also find astonishing Egyptian-styled sarcophagi topped bizarrely with Graeco-Roman faces; a fusion of artistic traditions that demonstrates just what a cultural meeting point this part of the world has always been.What you won't find is anything post-mediaeval. Modern Lebanon just doesn't exist in its national museum. It can't exist because the cultures that meet there these days could never agree on what story should be told. Indeed, the museum's only modern artefact is the bullet hole from the Lebanese civil war that punctures the bottom-left corner of perhaps its most impressive Byzantine mosaic.So it is in Beirut, and indeed Lebanon as a whole. There are Sunni, Christian and Shiite areas, but there are no national areas. Nation-states typically go to great lengths to convey their propaganda to the public, to articulate a national mythology. But Lebanon doesn't even bother. Beirut has no monuments to independence, founding fathers or national heroes. It doesn't even have the oversized photos of presidents (or prime ministers) that are so compulsory throughout the Middle East.In Lebanon, modern heroes are sectarian, and modern national symbols are tragic and embody unresolved conflict. Like the iconic Holiday Inn, left gutted and burnt from the civil war, sitting hauntingly among a clutch of shiny downtown high-rises. If there's a national identity in Lebanon, it's so heavily obscured by bullet holes that very few of its politicians can see it.''Nations who don't find their national identities are doomed to be the prey of other nations.'' So declared Ataturk in 1923. He was, of course, speaking with post-Ottoman Turkey in mind, but it is hard to imagine a more penetrating description of Lebanon. After decades of watching its politicians play up sectarian divisions and seek support from foreign powers, Lebanon has become not so much a country as a theatre for regional geo-politics.And so the Shiites - now most actively represented by Hezbollah - take their orders from Iran and the Assad regime in Syria, while Sunnis seek support from Saudi Arabia, and embrace Syria's increasingly radical rebels. No group can conceive of its own interests without their foreign patrons: even Lebanon's Christians who have floated back towards Assad as their protector against Sunni radicalism.Just this past week Beirut has seen a former finance minister assassinated and a (Sunni) suicide bomber kill five civilians in a Shiite neighbourhood. And yet neither is a domestic Lebanese matter, because almost nothing is. The assassination is most likely an order from Syria, reasserting Assad's will in Lebanon. The suicide bombing is clear retaliation for Hezbollah's involvement in the Syrian civil war, fighting for the Assad regime. It's an involvement that has merely encouraged the same international terrorist groups fighting Assad to start terrorising Lebanon, thereby exposing Hezbollah's claim to be ''resisting'' foreign aggression on behalf of Lebanon as a sham, and making clear that they are merely providing Lebanese muscle for Iran.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is offering $3 billion to strengthen the Lebanese army. Its aim seems obvious enough: to gain influence over the only viable military alternative to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Lebanese Sunnis are likely to welcome it, because they would love a Lebanese army sympathetic to their interests. The Shiites, however, are in a bind. Do they really want a strong Lebanese army, or would they prefer it to remain weak enough for Hezbollah to dominate?It boils down to this: Lebanon is now a contest between the two real powers of the region - Saudi Arabia and Iran. And in this respect, Lebanon is a microcosm; a place that merely distils the real game of Middle Eastern politics.It's visible in the Syrian civil war, which is far less civil than it seems since it has become a proxy confrontation between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which is cheerfully funding rebel groups, hoping desperately for Assad to fall. It's visible in the outraged Saudi reaction to America's nuclear deal with Iran struck last November. It's even visible in Iraq, where Iran has profited handsomely from America's removal of Saddam Hussein and the emergence of a Shiite government, and where the Saudi government stands accused of funding Sunni terrorist groups who have now spectacularly gained control of Fallujah.The Sunni-Shiite divide is now definitive. But it's more manufactured than it first appears: a convenient dividing line the Saudis and Iranians can use to mobilise support. Only recently has this sectarianism become so radioactive. Most deeply these divisions are political. This is an old story of competing nations - here acting as empires - dividing for conquest.And here we return to Ataturk's dictum. This Saudi-Iran havoc is only possible because the Middle East is crammed with countries whose national identities have never truly been resolved; whose borders have been horrifically drawn to capture almost nothing coherent; who shook off colonisation only to discover they didn't quite know who they were in these new, often arbitrary political formations. And sometimes, if you don't know who you are, it's just easier to fight who you're not.
**********Political change happens at warp speed in age of snap-judgement********December 27, 2013******0**** This year we've had three prime ministers, Victoria has had two premiers, the Northern Territory has had two chief ministers - and while we're at it, Catholics have had two popes.In only one case was an election and a change of government involved. It's possible to see this as the assembly of unconnected coincidences, as though this remarkable tally is to be consigned to the annals of trivia, indicative of nothing.It's possible to explain each of these leadership transitions on its own terms: the Gillard/Rudd fiasco - and Abbott's subsequent ascension - as a function of a dysfunctional Labor Party; Ted Baillieu's demise as the failure of a weak leader; Terry Mills as the victim of a diabolical policy decision to raise electricity prices in the Northern Territory. But in 12 months? It's as though time is being compressed.I mark 2013 as the year the consequences of a public and political culture operating at warp speed started to become clear.Already there's evidence the velocity is set to continue. The Abbott government, having barely been in office 100 days, already trails in the polls. It has enjoyed nothing even approximating a honeymoon period and, more than that, has failed even to enjoy a phase of post-election inertia in which the electorate looks elsewhere and just sticks with its decision.In falling behind so quickly, the government has set a new record. And this despite having taken over from a Labor government that even sympathisers would quietly concede was unelectable, despite facing an opposition that has hardly been rampaging.History says it's very unlikely, but it's possible Abbott will be a one-term prime minister. Like Gillard. And Rudd. Maybe it's too early to say a cross-partisan pattern is emerging in Australian politics, but it's certainly not too early to ask.There are lots of explanations for the Abbott government's early slide. It botched education policy. Its attempt to trim its media profile runs the risk of looking evasive, particularly on its signature policy area of immigration. The relationship with Indonesia has taken a beating on its watch, even if the spying activity that has so enraged the Indonesians came from Labor's time in office.Coalition MPs have been caught spending taxpayers' money in dubious circumstances. And, perhaps most importantly, Australia never heartily embraced Abbott's Coalition. That much was evident the morning after the election, when it became clear that most of the swing away from Labor and the Greens went to novelty parties, with the Coalition picking up less than a quarter of it.If it's true the electorate never really warmed to Abbott, it's because his style in opposition was so aggressive that there was little warmth to go around. But it's also true that this is exactly the reason he's now PM. It was a stunningly successful method that had Labor on the ropes for almost an entire electoral term. His critics will say he bludgeoned the electorate with simplistic sloganeering, and that the noise made life impossible for a government running a complex series of arguments. Maybe. But why did it work?I think it's because Abbott's approach was so perfectly suited to the age.Much has been written about the 24-hour news cycle and the culture of sound-bite politics it generates. All that is true. But the problem is much bigger than that. It's society-wide.Our entire mode of living is now built on speed. We communicate instantly and constantly, and we command an impressive array of gadgets to facilitate this. The moment we receive news, we're reacting to it, usually with virtual people whose role - either as ideological friend or foe - is predetermined.A political development is not as important as the immediate argument we intend to prosecute with it. We've arranged ourselves into teams, and we take our cues from our teammates. We're becoming captive to a kind of digital tribalism.This is a whole new sociology, and it brings with it a whole new politics of obstinate snap-judgment. Put simply, we commit too hard, too early. That's why political parties take the huge step of replacing leaders so much faster than they used to. They know we're not really for turning any more. And that's because, while we're smothered with information, we simply don't have time to digest it. But since we all have megaphones now, it's unthinkable to be silent; to have nothing to say. So we make noise. And, in the process, what we're losing as a society is the capacity for reflection.That is a social environment fundamentally suited to the task of opposition. Abbott seemed to know that instinctively. He didn't ask us to judge, rather than reflect. And he set up rapidly digestible templates to help us make those snap judgments. Templates that would undermine any government such as: unpredictability and crises in government are a result of incompetence. Hence ''no surprises, no excuses''. Thus did he vanquish two prime ministers.Now, as his government faces its own surprises, and necessarily must find the odd excuse, it fails its own tests from opposition. Sure, every government is wobbly early, and there's every chance this one will find its feet and recover. But if it doesn't, it could be that Tony Abbott is his own third scalp. In a sense, he's running against himself. More profoundly, he's running against the times.
**********Death of car industry 30 years in the making********December 13, 2013******0**** In the short term, there's no consistency in politics. Back when the Gillard government announced the carbon tax, it took approximately six seconds for the Coalition to scream that this would cost jobs and devastate entire towns. Bollocks, retorted Labor, occasionally by way of karaoke. Sure, some industries would be hit, but they're the kind of industries the environment needs us to scale back. Meanwhile, we'll create shiny, new, eco-friendly jobs. People will retrain, and find new opportunities. The workforce is adaptable and dynamic.Now, without anybody really noticing, Labor and the Coalition seem to have swapped positions. As Labor inspects the carcass of the Australian car industry, it foreshadows monstrous job losses, the devastation of manufacturing towns in South Australia and Victoria, and protests that you can't simply ask people who have spent their lives assembling cars suddenly to work in nursing homes. And the Coalition is suddenly brimming with confidence that these things are always transient, evolving and ultimately leave us stronger. ''No Whyalla wipeout'' sings Abbott. Oh, wait.But in the long run, things are far more consistent than all that. The truth is that the death of Australian car manufacturing did not begin on September 7. It began 30 years ago when the Hawke government commenced the job of abolishing tariffs, opening us to global competition. This was declared a necessary step in Australia's economic evolution. It would bring growth, dynamism, and after some pain, prosperity. When Labor today argues the Coalition is sacrificing blue-collar workers at the altar of an economic theory, it omits that in Australia, Labor was that very theory's midwife. Ask Paul Keating. Actually, don't bother. He's already given his answer when asked what he'd say to blue-collar workers whose jobs disappeared on his watch: ''What do I say: what's your new job like? … I mean, did we ever hurt anybody liberating them from the car assembly line?''For now, an argument rages on whether more government money would have saved Holden. The opposition insists $150 million would have done it. The government points out that Holden, like Ford before it has been ''saved'' in this manner several times before, only to be unsaved and threaten to leave again. The truth is we'll never know because Holden won't tell us, and even if they did, they'd be guessing. Either way, the government's argument is intensely interesting because it boils down to the assertion that there is nothing it could reasonably have done to prevent this. That this decision was out of its hands, and was based on economic factors largely beyond its control. But in defending itself, it has made an epic admission: that we're not really in control of our economy.And that much is the heretical truth. We chose to make it true when we threw our lot in with the global free market. We'll never admit this in stark terms. We'll continue to argue over each sensational development such as this week's. But the grander theme cannot be resisted that we do not call our own shots; that no longer is there a hierarchy of political being with the nation-state at the top and everyone else - corporations, civil society and citizens - below. Power is shared now. Companies play countries off against each other looking for the best deal, much as you and I might haggle over a retail purchase. Our world isn't exactly borderless - and some countries are more protectionist than others - but those borders now seem to denote zones rather than dominions. The world is a country now, and nations are its cities.And that's where the difficulties start. The idea of an economy is that people can move within it; that labour flows to where it is most needed. And in the case of car manufacturing, our workers just aren't needed. Not because they're not good at what they do, but because countless other people are good at it too, and for a fraction of the cost.It's not just Australia experiencing this. Take Japan, that car manufacturing behemoth. It's lost about a quarter of its industry in the past five years. Even South Korea, whose workers earn about half of what ours do, has been in decline since 2011. These cars are now made in China and Thailand. Cheaply. Remember Gina Rinehart's declaration that Australia can't compete while Africans are prepared to work for $2 per day? The problem with her argument is not that she's wrong. It's that by the global free market's own lights, she is scandalously right.Those lights tell us to specialise; to do what we can do better, or cheaper than anyone else. That's the logic we've embraced. Just last week we signed a free trade agreement with South Korea, which both major parties had worked on. The upshot: great for agriculture, bad for car manufacturing. Labor didn't quibble. Trade Minister Andrew Robb said the agreement was about ''backing our strengths''. That's what we do now.But nations are diverse. The people within them have a huge range of skills. Globalisation's demand that every nation specialise sits in contradiction with the social fact that not everyone is well placed to fit within our specialties. The market, of course, has its solution to that, too: labour mobility. You either acquire new skills or go where your skills will be rewarded. But the social and political reality is far more complicated. Perpetual reskilling is expensive and not always successful, and Holden's workforce isn't about to move to Thailand.The larger story here isn't really about our car industry, or whether we could have delayed Holden's decision to some other day. It's about the fact that our politics doesn't match our economics: that the assumptions of a hyper-specialised global free market and its effortlessly mobile labour force don't reflect the more diversified, comparatively static nature of our societies. Twenty years from now Holden's departure will be just another marker on a journey whose direction is clear and irreversible. We'll continue shedding industries. We'll continue developing new ones. But no one can honestly guarantee that the same people harmed in the first process will be rescued by the second. And the political heat this generates will merely disguise the fact that this is a matter of political consensus.
**********Equality more than just a matter of language********November 1, 2013******0**** Amid all the pyrotechnics surrounding same-sex marriage this week, it's important to remember that this is overwhelmingly a symbolic debate. That doesn't mean it's unimportant. Symbolism matters to us in a visceral way, sometimes even more than substance. That is why flag-burning is such a provocative act. But it's important to know when something is symbolic so we can assess what has, or hasn't, been achieved.It's true there are real, substantive issues of discrimination at play. Same-sex couples don't have the same rights and entitlements as married heterosexual ones do on a range of things: workers' compensation, death benefits, pensions for the partners of defence force veterans, access to carer's leave, for example.It's true same-sex marriage would quickly remedy this. But it's also true that you could remove that discrimination by amending the way those entitlements work without even thinking about same-sex marriage. And if you did that, marriage-equality activists would still want to change the definition of marriage, and their opponents would still resist. In fact, their opponents would probably be happy to give same-sex couples all those rights if they'd just leave marriage alone.That's why the ACT government found itself in court this week, defending its marriage equality legislation from the federal government's legal attack, why a same-sex marriage bill was debated in the NSW Parliament on Thursday, and why the Tasmanian upper house ultimately decided not to proceed with similar legislation of its own. None of these laws, which could operate only at state and territory levels, remedy same-sex discrimination in a stroke. They are political acts designed to make symbolic, political statements.This is clearest in the case of the ACT legislation, which, one way or another, is doomed to failure. Even if it wins in the High Court, the federal government can - and almost certainly will - override the legislation because it has the power to do that to a territory. The ACT will have opened the way for states, but territorians must surely know that every marriage they contract under this legislation will one day be annulled. The ACT government surely knows this, too. It isn't looking for a substantive result. It's trying to apply pressure to the federal government.But something strange has arisen this week in the attempt to do that. So strong is the sense that marriage equality's moment is approaching, and so frenzied is the race to get there that marriage-equality advocates have begun, in the most subtle but truly remarkable way, to argue against their own position.The ACT's fight with the federal government comes down to whether or not the federal Marriage Act is intended to be a comprehensive statement on the definition of marriage, which precludes the states from having anything to say on the matter. If so, the laws are inconsistent and the federal law prevails. This is for the High Court to decide, and while the ACT certainly has a chance of winning, there's no doubt it's vulnerable. At least, that is the view of Bret Walker, SC, one of the country's best constitutional lawyers, who has been advising Australian Marriage Equality. But, he says, the NSW bill and its (now defunct) Tasmanian counterpart are on stronger ground.The key difference is that those bills don't attempt to redefine marriage. In fact, they avoid legislating on marriage at all. Instead, they create a new species of legal relationship that happens to be called ''same-sex marriage''. Since this is not the same thing as ''marriage'' in the meaning of federal law, it can't be treading on federal toes. It's a neat legal technique. It's a strong legal argument. The only problem for marriage-equality activists is that it completely undermines the cause. This is not simply a small matter of language. It's about changing the whole concept of the legislation.The very purpose of marriage equality is to extend the definition of marriage so it is blind to gender. That's what the ACT bill is attempting to do. And that's exactly what you don't do by sidestepping this process and creating an entirely new social construct that just happens to have ''marriage'' in its name. A ''same-sex marriage'' is just a civil union by a more political name.Really, you can call it what you like - a ''consolation marriage'' might be most honest - you've done nothing to change the legal definition of marriage. The NSW bill might offer same-sex marriage, but it's not offering marriage equality. It's a bit like republicans finally replacing the monarch with a system of hereditary, foreign-born presidents.As symbolic achievements go, that would be relatively anaemic. But now you have marriage-equality activists, who are typically uninspired by the prospect of civil unions, pleading with the ACT government to enact precisely that, and reacting angrily when it refuses to do so. Take independent NSW MP Alex Greenwich's warning that ''it is not going to be Tony Abbott, it is not going to be the High Court that will be blamed for the invalidation of these marriages, it will be the ACT government that will be blamed''. Perhaps. But the ACT's response would surely be that at least they had marriages to annul.Meanwhile, opponents of marriage equality, who frequently offer civil unions as some kind of compromise, seem not to have seen the opportunity. Presently, they're delighting in their victory in Tasmania, but the staggering onward march of same-sex marriage - which now transcends traditional partisan or conservative/progressive lines - suggests that victory can only be pyrrhic. Perhaps their best strategy would be to limit same-sex marriage to consolation, state-level status, especially if their opponents seem happy with that. One look at the NSW and Tasmanian bills and they should be leaping on them, screaming: ''Deal! Are we done, now?''
**********First the Islamic car, now you can't say Allah********October 18, 2013******0**** Six years ago, Proton - Malaysia's national car maker - teamed up with carmakers in Iran and Turkey pledging to develop the world's first ''Islamic car''. Apparently automobiles had hitherto been non-Muslims.If that's not absurd enough, this week we learnt it's a good thing Malaysian cars can't talk, because if they could, they'd no longer be able to use the word ''Allah'' to mean ''God''. That's what a Malaysian appeal court ruled this week, after a Catholic, Malay-language newspaper had dared to drop the A-bomb.The ''Allah'' controversy has been running for years, and isn't over yet. This decision overturned the original finding from 2009 in favour of the newspaper. Now the editor is planning to appeal to the highest court in the country and the government will resist.This immediately reminded me of Proton's Islamic car: strip both these stories of the pious language that decorates them, and they're ultimately about the maintenance of Malay pride. These are symbolic gestures of ethno-nationalism. And that whole issue is becoming increasingly radioactive in Malaysian politics and society.To see this, consider what precisely makes the Islamic car so ''Islamic'': compartments for storing a headscarf and Koran, and a compass to indicate the direction of Mecca. That's it. As though no car in history has sported a compass or storage. If you're in any doubt about how thin this Islamic veneer is, consider that Proton was considering a ''secular'' version for non-Muslim majority markets.This is not about function. It's not meeting a consumer need. This is appealing to consumer identity. It's selling a feeling of authenticity. Don't just be a Muslim. Be very Muslim. The content of that commitment matters far less than the statement it makes.The ''Allah'' imbroglio is altogether more serious, but no less strange. Arab Christians, Jews and pagans were using the word before Islam came along. The word has always appeared in Arabic translations of the Bible without controversy. The same ultimately came to be true in the Malay language, which incorporates plenty of Arabic lexicon. So it's hardly surprising that Malaysian Christians have been using the word, too. For longer than Malaysia has existed, as it happens. It's in their Bibles, too.Why should this suddenly be a problem? The Malaysian court held that Allah ''is not an integral part of the faith in Christianity'' and that therefore its use in a Catholic newspaper ''will cause confusion in the community''. The fear, apparently, is that Muslims will suddenly start practising Christianity if both faith groups refer to God by the same name. Malaysian Muslims therefore need a form of protection from their own ignorance that no Muslim community has needed anywhere at any time.But this isn't about that. If it were, you'd expect Malaysia's Islamist opposition party (PAS) to be at the forefront of this charge. But they aren't. In fact, they're mildly opposed.This is instead about an old guard of Malays (who are officially always Muslims) confronting the fact the privileged position they've held for the first 50 years of Malaysian independence simply can't hold for the next 50. Now they're lashing out, as if trying to resist the death throes of their own supremacy.That supremacy is a matter of law. Indeed it's in the constitution, which establishes Malay quotas for entry into civil service, public education, and access to federal business licences. The idea was partly that Malays - who were vastly economically disadvantaged - would gain ground on the far wealthier Chinese. When the British drafted this law, the intention was that it would be temporary. Turns out it wasn't, and race has been a constant inflammation point in Malaysian politics ever since, as several race riots demonstrate.The ruling party, UMNO, is the great defender of this privilege. For decades it has served it well. But that edifice crumbled in 2008, when it lost an astonishing 58 seats and barely carried the popular vote. This year it lost even that, and clings to power only thanks to a brazen gerrymander.Its only solution seems to be to divide and conquer: to sell the image of a Malaysia where Malay supremacy is threatened by insurrectionist minorities - and indeed where its own power is falling victim to a ''Chinese tsunami''.Its newspapers boomed headlines such as ''What else do the Chinese want?'' and ''Chinese voters are two-faced''. Little wonder, then, that the government's non-Malay vote is now almost non-existent.But it's the diving Malay vote that is most interesting. Young, educated, urban Malays in particular are deserting this brand of politics. They're becoming increasingly sceptical of their privileged status. For all the affirmative action, they remain behind economically. Special access to government contracts has simply meant Malays with good (often familial) government connections get rich, while most watch on from their scarcely adequate dwellings. What began as empowerment ended in corruption.I don't know what became of the Islamic car. I've found barely any trace of it since it was announced in 2007. Maybe it was never made, because a new conception of Malaysia was made instead, a step removed from the identity politics of the colonial era, full of upwardly mobile people who aren't likely to be swayed by a Mecca-oriented compass.I guess that's the problem with being a car manufacturer: you have to accept social evolution at some point. You can't really gerrymander your way to a profit.
