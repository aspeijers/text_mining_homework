**********Nothing can wipe the smile off this mug********December 12, 2014******372**** Tony Abbott is at his best when he has something to fight. Ask Kevin Rudd. Or Julia Gillard. Or Malcolm Turnbull. Abbott vanquished them all with brutal efficiency, mainly because he had a devastatingly clear line of attack. "Great big toxic tax based on a lie," or something. Sure, that's more a mash-up than a quote, but with these eight words, Abbott destroyed three leaders. Even in power his best moments have come as he has seized upon an enemy, whether a Russian "bully" or an Islamist "death cult". But this week we've been asked to believe in a different character; a figure who looks and dresses like the pugilist we know, but whose every word presently seems to be of compromise and conciliation. "This is a government which is always capable of listening, learning and improving" he insisted as he unveiled an amended policy on GP co-payments. It was only one of three such announcements in half a week. First came Abbott's pledge to reconsider his paid parental leave scheme over summer, and last came his $200 million volte-face on contributing to an international climate change fund he clearly hates so much he said it was worthy of Bob Brown. But there's something revealing about the gently declaratory language, here. It's trying to convince us of something. It's like he's describing his attributes at a job interview. Trouble is he's had the job for a year, and he's not describing the guy we hired. Abbott's going for more than a policy change. He's going for a radical change in character. In modern politics conviction and compromise sit, lamentably, at opposite poles. Abbott styled himself as an avatar for austere conviction: the immovable tough guy for whom nothing could be worse than a "dodgy deal" with a minor party. Abbott created a political universe in which negotiation was almost dishonest – an abandonment of principles for political convenience. That, in brief, was his deadly portrait of Julia Gillard. Now, in the richest of ironies, he's forced to become her: an unloved prime minister, saddled with broken promises seeking the favour of minor parties and independents. If the electorate's emphatic attitude to so much of the Abbott government's budget is any guide, this is nothing less than necessary. But it's also nothing less than awkward, and that raises the serious risk that it will look insincere. Abbott needs to be supremely convincing here, and he's starting from a long way behind. When you've delivered perhaps the most friendless budget in living memory, then stood by it for seven long months with precious little hint of compromise, you can't simply smooth things over by proclaiming yourself to be a great listener. You need to demonstrate it. If you're trying to reboot your way out of disaster, you need to make it unmistakable. You need to change the game so completely that all the most serious charges against you become completely redundant in a single stroke. Anything less and the critique against you gets a reboot, too. And that, I suspect, is where Abbott runs aground. His compromises are real enough, but also modest enough that none of them cause his opponents to break stride. At the end of this week, the most stinging critiques engulfing the government remain undisturbed. Abbott's revised GP co-payment might take pity on kids, pensioners, veterans and concession card holders, but there are plenty of poor Australians besides these and it will still hit them hardest. Labor gets to make that argument again, now. And it even gets to repeat that the policy doesn't help the budget. All the savings are being parked in a medical research fund for over a decade instead of paying off the debt we've been told will bring Armageddon upon our kids. The numbers may have changed, but the narrative has not. It's a similar story on climate change. Our $200 million contribution is welcome (even if it does simply come from our foreign aid budget), but it does little to deal with the overall charge that this is a government taking the path of most resistance. Australia's abstinence from the climate change fund was the very least of the facts that buttressed this allegation. After all, what's $200 million for a fund like that when you're trying to abolish a $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation that you've just finished telling the world is a similar, terrible concept? How does this cost-free gesture stand against the tide of reduced aspirations for renewable energy and a pointed commitment to a 2020 emissions reduction target that the government's own independent advice insists is way too skimpy? All this suggests that the government doesn't truly understand its present rejection. It seems to believe the electorate likes the government's general direction, but would rather it didn't quite go so far; that voters' concerns are really only matters of degree. In fact, those objections are philosophical. For better or worse, they don't object to the extent of the budget, but the very idea of it. You can't tinker your way out of that. That's the problem with being a fighter: you see compromise ultimately as defeat. Not a constructive process, but a destructive one to be considered only at the point of inevitable catastrophe. And so it cannot help but be half-hearted. "We had a good policy in the first place. Now we have a better policy," said Abbott of his GP co-payment.  Such are the fighter's instincts that even at the moment of defeat, when you're trying to admit you got it wrong, you just can't help insisting that you've really been right all along.
**********Coalition marooned in a sea of troubles********November 28, 2014******554**** Maybe leaders should just stop doing outdoor television interviews on the eve of an election. Remember Julia Gillard's "no carbon tax" declaration, standing in front of the Brisbane skyline? Sorry, of course you do. It's astonishing how much it resembles Tony Abbott's albatross. Abbott is standing in a stadium, as befits his relative sportiness, but this aside it's just about a perfect match. Each has given the most perfectly destructive grab: a crisp, unequivocal statement that promises in less than 10 seconds exactly the opposite of what they would come to do once the election was over. This week's focus has been on cuts to public broadcasting, but it's the sheer breadth of Abbott's promises – almost all of which are now violated – that makes it so compelling.  You'd think you could at least stumble or ramble a bit to draw out the clip and make it a little less usable. But no. By election eve you've learned your lines. It's only afterwards, apparently, that you forget them.This stuff can really hurt, as Gillard so brutally discovered. Abbott's case is perhaps a little less dire. His broken promises don't directly raise the cost of living, and so don't quite lend themselves to a carbon-tax-sized scare campaign. He doesn't lead a party desperate to tear itself apart to the point of being unelectable. He faces an Opposition Leader not remotely as effective as Abbott was himself. But Abbott has other problems that mean his broken promises operate more as a garnish. They don't need to be the whole catastrophe because they sit atop something more substantial. You see, the Abbott government is now in trouble. Really quite serious trouble. Trouble from which it will take a special effort to emerge.The hyperventilating about Abbott being a one-term Prime Minister has always struck me as the wishful thinking of those already implacably opposed to him, oblivious to the lessons of political history. Changes of government are rare and one-term governments almost mythical. But as I write this on the eve of an election that looks set to terminate a one-term government in Victoria, in which Victorian Liberals are describing Abbott's influence as poison, it is clear that political history is changing. Governments run their course quickly these days. Even the previous Labor era felt like two one-term governments, each of which ran aground at the first available poll. Last year we had three Prime Ministers, the Northern Territory had two Chief Ministers and Victoria had two Premiers. This year, New South Wales has done the same. Not one of these discarded leaders had been in the job for a complete electoral term. It's now possible Abbott might be the same.There's no singular issue responsible for this. That's actually the problem. The government is struggling not for anything particular it has done, but for who the electorate thinks it is. This isn't simply the government that cut ABC funding – far more modestly, as it happens, than Howard did before waltzing his way to electoral success.  This isn't the government that wants to increase student debts, or raise the cost of petrol, or charge poor people to visit the doctor, or take the dole away from young unemployed people. It's the government that wants to do all of these things. This isn't about policy. It's about values. Abbott's problem is that he's allowed a this image to solidify as his government's character.In a word, it's about fairness. And here – still – stands the government's budget which has become the lens through which all else is seen. Abbott can plausibly claim a mandate for taking action to improve the budget. In all likelihood he can even inflict some pain to get there.  But – as John Howard so frequently warned – you can only convince the electorate to hurt if they believe they're hurting fairly. And it is on precisely this score that Abbott has so dramatically lost the argument. There has been no compelling rebuttal to the claim that it is the poorest and the most vulnerable – low-income earners, pensioners, unemployed kids – who are being hit. This is how Abbott's parental leave policy – which was meant to be about empowering women – has instead become about class: about empowering rich people who happen to be women. It's how the government's perfectly sensible decision to unfreeze the excise on petrol suddenly became a war on poor motorists. And it's undoubtedly how any attempt by this government to advocate a raised GST, maturely or otherwise, will come to be seen. That's what happens when the narrative against you is clear, damaging and well set.The great predicament for Abbott is that by falling foul of the fairness test, he has wandered into one of Labor's very few remaining sweet spots. For decades now, Labor has struggled to explain its identity, which is why on, say, immigration or national security it finds itself hopelessly trapped, tiptoeing inauthentically along a line largely determined by the Coalition. Labor's most authentic moment arrived in 2007, when Howard served up a fight on WorkChoices. This was Labor in its element. Fairness isn't quite as sharp, but it at least feels like a Labor theme. And now Abbott's compelled to fight on that turf.Abbott somehow needs to break the thematic stranglehold. Perhaps that's why he has reportedly decided to dump his GP co-payment. It's why he'll probably, under great sufferance, dump his paid parental leave scheme. And maybe this will be enough to save him once he passes a more generous budget or two before the next election. But it's getting to the point where he needs a grand gesture that impacts the wealthy. A temporary debt levy on high-income earners is all it has right now, and it's already been forgotten. He needs something truly big; something like a crackdown on superannuation tax concessions for high-income earners which could raise billions. But ask a Coalition MP why they have studiously avoided this and you'll get a simple answer: we promised before the election we wouldn't touch super. And you can't break your promises, can you?
**********Gesture politics wax as power to control wanes********November 14, 2014******185**** I'll get to the shirt-front in a minute. First, though, it's worth remembering how we got here. How so very livid we were about the MH17 disaster. How this was something more visceral than mourning, something that demanded retribution. How immediately the political class distilled this rage. Tony Abbott quickly dubbed it a "crime" rather than an "accident" and Bill Shorten described it as a "tyrannical, wild act" presumably carried out by "separatist terrorists". In a flash we were off to the UN Security Council to secure "full, impartial and international" investigation – which, truth be told, sat a fraction awkwardly with the fact that we'd already decided who was to blame. Whatever, it felt great. We would hold the perpetrators accountable. We would bring the bodies home, even launching a quasi-military operation to do so.  We were throwing our weight around: talking super tough to Russia while other lily-livered leaders, like British Prime Minister David Cameron, were tweeting anaemically about "meeting to establish the facts".But four months later, what? The bodies – most of them anyway – haven't returned. No one has been held accountable. Forensic investigators have barely visited the crash site, which by now must be impossibly contaminated. No justice has been done. Last month Julie Bishop managed to get Vladmir Putin's "assurance" that he would help investigators access the crash site.  Which is pretty much what he assured us in July.  Oh, and we've just asked Russia to apologise. They said no.Don't blame the Abbott government for this. The truth is there is nothing it could have done. The problem is there never was. At no stage did we have any meaningful leverage over Russia. We had no meaningful imports to ban and no meaningful sanctions to impose. That's exactly why we were so free to shoot our mouth off: we had nothing much at stake. That this has achieved nothing concrete was merely inevitable. So, of course, there was no shirt-front – whatever that was meant to mean. The very idea was always fantasy. But it will not do to let Shorten trade on it as a "diplomatic faux pas".  It was Shorten, after all, who goaded Abbott to this belligerence. We forget that Shorten was sounding off on the fact that Putin was coming to Brisbane for the G20, raging that "laying out the red carpet" is not how you "deal with an international bully". "Go on, Tony, sock him one," screamed the subtext.  "What are you, a girly man?"It was a cynical brand of opportunism for which Shorten has never been called to account.  He knew full well that the decision to receive Putin was not Abbott's, and that Australia had no power to prevent the visit. Shorten's rhetoric had nothing to do with the national interest. He cast a populist line and Abbott took the bait. Abbott is responsible for his own words, but let us not pretend the ridiculous posing is anything other than bipartisan.Perhaps that's because the posing is all we have. About the most galling fact about our world is that sometimes there are monstrous injustices for which we are powerless to seek redress. In such moments we frequently pretend otherwise. We roar our disapproval. We pledge results we simply cannot deliver. We do this, not because it changes anything material, but because this ritual anger is its own end. And that's what our raging towards Russia has ultimately been: an exercise in gesture politics.This is increasingly the truth that confronts our political leaders. Whatever power they possess, it seems to be less and less capable of dealing with what concerns us. Over a decade ago we promised to hunt down every last terrorist. Now the problem is bigger than ever despite the years of military action and ever toughening security legislation that was meant to solve it. The result, of course, will be more gestures of this kind, giving us at least the conviction that we're doing something. Last week we discovered just how severely tax-savvy multinational corporations were screwing us by hiding their profits in tax havens. We can tinker at this, but ultimately Luxembourg has more say in it than we do. This week we discovered the federal budget had something like a $51 billion shortfall thanks significantly to the fact that iron ore prices are dropping off. Joe Hockey disputes the figure, but no one disputes the concept. For this government as for its predecessor, massive holes are being punched in its revenue while it looks on helplessly. Meanwhile the US and China have just struck an emissions reduction agreement that, if China can be held to it, will likely mean a serious reduction in our coal exports. If our economic outlook just took a pummelling, it did so without our involvement. That's the point, really. We simply don't control such things any more.It's amazing how many of the current government's predicaments seem like ghosts of the previous government's ones. And how each opposition seems convinced that every problem is entirely within the hands of a competent government to solve, if only we had one. Sure, some policy responses to these problems are better than others. We could reform the tax system or close tax loopholes to make our revenue more reliable, for instance. It's not that we can do nothing at all. It's just that in so many cases we can do nothing hugely consequential. But it is ingrained in our political debate to pretend otherwise. Our loss of control seems matched only by our bluster. In cases like MH17, it's catharsis. In such moments the illusion of power matters more than the reality of it. This, it seems, is a characteristic of our age: as our power escapes the grasp of our governments, they become ever more occupied with the gestures that mask its absence.
**********Insane, antisocial loners a new type of terrorist********October 31, 2014******173**** The dispiriting news feels like it's coming in a torrent. Canada suffers two terrorist attacks in a week. Another attack in New York, this one with an axe, wounds two police officers before the attacker is shot dead. Immediately you recall the Melbourne case of Abdul Numan Haider, whose weapon of choice was a knife, but whose story had the same ending.  Meanwhile, a Sydney teenager plays a starring role in two ISIL propaganda videos in a fortnight, while the man who apparently groomed and recruited him, Mohammad Ali Baryalei, is now very likely dead. This, you might feel, is encouraging until you consider that his symbolic pull is likely only to increase as a result of his "martyrdom".But pause for a moment and you notice something about this picture. We're a long way from all the talk of dirty bombs and nuclear weapons of the Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld era. We're nowhere near planes smashing into skyscrapers. We're not even in the neighbourhood of bombs being detonated on buses and underground trains, or in nightclubs. This stuff is galling and tragic. It occasions the same public grieving and ceremony, but we're talking about something qualitatively different, here. For the moment at least, mass-casualty terrorism is off the agenda. "Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run over him with your car," urged ISIL last month as it called upon Muslims to kill random Westerners. There's a kind of desperate crudeness, here: one that seems to have lowered its horizons. Today it's about low-casualty, mass-impact terrorism. But that impact is far more psychological than it is material.The point is not to dismiss this as trivial. It's serious, not least because it's clear that a few people have acted on ISIL's instructions. It's serious because, while mass-casualty attacks are clearly more devastating, they're also much harder to pull off. Rather, the point is to note that something has changed. Terrorism is evolving. And so are the terrorists.You see, they're dickheads now. David Leyonhjelm's description is a disarming one because it recasts these people as self-aggrandising amateurs. There's more than an element of truth to this. Zale Thompson's axe-wielding attack in New York lasted a mere seven seconds before he was shot. He was, by all accounts, an unemployed loner with a record of multiple arrests. In Canada, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau was living in a homeless shelter before he decided to open fire on the Parliament Building. This was a man with a crack cocaine habit, a suite of drug possession and theft episodes, and a history of mental illness. In this respect his story isn't so far from Baryalei's, which has more to do with cocaine, gambling and Kings Cross strip clubs than it does with advanced explosives training and a piercing political manifesto. He, too, has a history of mental illness, much like Khaled Sharrouf, who so infamously tweeted a picture of his son holding a severed head, and who was also diagnosed with schizophrenia.This isn't the way terrorism has tended to work.  For all our knee-jerk descriptions of terrorists as mad, psychopathic or otherwise psychologically disturbed, decades of research has now demonstrated the opposite: that despite their clearly abnormal behaviour, terrorists are overwhelmingly sane and psychologically normal. Nor have they tended to be antisocial loners. Terrorism has almost always been a group activity, carried out in cells that have strong bonds of solidarity between members. Certainly there have been "lone wolves" in history – some of them, such as the Unabomber, suffering from mental illness – but these have been exceptions to a well established rule.But ISIL is playing by different rules. Its reach amongst Westerners is clearly skewed towards converts and born-again Muslims, often with troubled pasts. It tends not to appeal as much to those with long-held, well established religious commitments. That's because ISIL isn't merely offering an ideology. Like all fundamentalisms, it's offering an identity: a chance for people to reimagine themselves and restart their lives by turning their back in the most radical fashion on everything they've left behind. What better way to prove you're free from the yoke of sin and drugs and sleaze than quite literally to take up arms against them? It's not just the violence. It's the illusion of purity and self-sacrifice that goes with it that is attractive.This is particularly potent in an online era. It is precisely the fact that ISIL is so devastatingly effective online that means it doesn't have to rely on the kind of group solidarity that has typically held terrorism together. This opens terrorism to people who previously would have been a liability. Someone who is mentally unstable or struggles to work with others is wholly unsuited to the kind of careful, secret planning that is so fundamental to professional terrorism. But no such concern applies when you're trying to unleash the kind of rudimentary, randomised mayhem ISIL is. Suddenly the lone wolf, which was once an odd curiosity, is an emerging trend that sits near the top of the list of every Western security agency's worries.Those agencies will respond with what they know: increased hard power. It's why we're so attracted to more counterterrorism laws and military intervention. We have this intuitive understanding that these things work. And sometimes, in the short term, they do. But at some point we'll have to recognise that even as we chalk up successes like killing senior terrorist figures, the problem only seems to grow. Who'd have thought 10  years ago that we'd be raising the terror threat level to its highest point in our history after Osama bin Laden had been killed?That happens because we're dealing with something that is deeply, irrevocably social. Eradicating it therefore becomes as complex as eradicating any social disease. Truth is we've never figured out how to solve those. We can't stop drug use.  We can't stop disaffection. We can't stop alienation. Not entirely, anyway. And perhaps we can't eradicate radicalisation, either, at least until the whole ghastly experiment of militant Islamism collapses under the weight of its nihilistic contradictions. But in the meantime, it won't be crushed by our sledgehammers.
**********Burqa ban a political excuse for persecution********October 3, 2014******988**** Even before the embarrassing back-down there were problems. For starters, it's not a burqa. A burqa is that particularly Afghan garment, usually blue, with the mesh covering the eyes. The one you've seen on the news (or perhaps on Jacqui Lambie's Facebook page), but almost certainly never in Australia. We're talking about the niqab, common in the Gulf and worn by – my guess – a couple of hundred Australians. I have to guess, because we don't even bother with such basic research before we consider banning such things.It says everything that we can't even get the name right; that merely to be understood in the argument, you must get it wrong. Of itself, it's not a big deal, but it symbolises the calibre of the public conversation. It's as if we're demanding a pernicious, industrial-scale ignorance. As if we're proud of it. We'll tell these women what their clothing signifies. We'll tell them why they wear it. We'll even rename it for them if we want. These women will be deconstructed and reconstructed at our will, and without their involvement. These are the terms of the debate and the most influential voices will be the most ignorant.But ignorance is no barrier precisely because this debate really has nothing to do with the women being recast as some kind of problem. Strip it all back and they've done nothing to invite this. They aren't the ones charged with plotting "demonstration killings". They aren't the ones being busted carrying weapons or attacking police officers.  They are, however, the ones most often assaulted or abused on the street or on public transport. They're the ones whose freedom we try most to restrict. In short, they become the symbolic target for our rage; the avatar we choose to represent a generalised enemy, and the threat it poses. In this, we obey what seems a diabolically universal principle: that whatever the outrage, whatever the fear, and whatever the cause, it is women that must suffer first and most.So perhaps you'll forgive these women if they don't come out in droves to thank Senator Cory Bernardi for rescuing them from what he regards a "shroud of oppression" that "represents the repressive domination of men over women".Perhaps you'll understand they see something other than feminist concern in these words; that Bernardi might look to them a lot like Lord Cromer did to the Egyptian women he colonised in the 19th century.Cromer similarly decided Egyptian women needed emancipation, and that that they should therefore remove their veils. Meanwhile, back in England, he was the president of the Men's League for Opposing Woman Suffrage.Before the change of heart it was a burqa ban (see, even I'm doing it now) in Parliament House. The argument was about security, but it's a thin pretext. If you need to identify someone entering the building, it's dead easy to do: you take them aside to a private space and ask them to reveal their face for identification purposes. Then you subject them to the same screening as everyone else.In fact, we already do this sort of thing in airports and secure buildings with no fuss at all. The only reason there's a fuss now is that we've dreamt one up, as Prime Minister Tony Abbott's "mountain over a molehill" response suggests. I can find only one isolated example of an Australian using the anonymity of a niqab to commit a crime. By a man.This, of course, was enough for Bernardi to declare the niqab the emergent "preferred disguised of bandits and ne'er do wells", which must accordingly be banned. Not just in banks or Parliament, but everywhere. Very well then, let's get serious about this. I propose a ban on all disguises used by "bandits" anywhere, ever. Sorry kids, but Spider-Man's illegal now. Let's prosecute the CEO of K-Mart for providing material support to terrorism, or something. What are you, a weak-kneed apologist?No, the security discourse is mere rhetorical camouflage. Abbott's chief of staff Peta Credlin advised her party's anti-burqa brigade to mount their case in security terms – not because it is their primary concern, but because it was  most likely to succeed. If this looks like a solution in search of a problem, that's because the "solution" is the entire point.For Bernardi and Liberal backbencher George Christensen, who pushed it, the real goal is the total ban of the niqab in public. All else is pretext. Feminism doesn't work? Try security: whatever quasi-respectable way might open the door. It's the kind of argument that allows Coalition MPs such as the Nationals Darren Chester to argue that "we're talking about national security; we're not talking about religion or what people wear". Maybe that's true for Chester, but it clearly isn't for the MPs driving the cause.Now is when we find out what Team Australia really means. Now is when we discover if it's designed to unify a diverse nation or to demonise the socially unpopular.Attorney-General George Brandis has planted his flag in impeccably liberal style: "I have no concerns with Muslims wearing the burqa and I don't have a preference either because frankly it's none of [my] business". Abbott, too, has these instincts within him.It's often forgotten that back in 2006 when the Howard government was in the midst of an anti-veiling frenzy, it was he who wrote in the Liberal Party's journal that "ripping away Muslim girls' scarves is not going to make them more 'Australian'. If anything, it's almost certain to make them feel more vulnerable and 'different' ", and that "disparaging the religious symbols of Muslim Australians is at odds with our own best traditions". But he's a leader now. Everything he says is for someone. The question now is: for whom is he speaking? Which team does he have in mind when he decided to share that he wishes niqabs "weren't worn"?Given, on his own testimony, no niqabi has ever entered Parliament House, he knew that any ban would be symbolic. Before the back-down, it was merely a matter of which message he wanted to send.The one that upholds "our own best traditions"? Or the one that tells a minority they aren't welcome in their own Parliament? Waleed Aly is a Fairfax columnist.

**********Seeking calm amid violence, fear and outrage********September 18, 2014******362**** It's the sheer randomness of it that makes it so terrifying. The idea that the victim would be utterly generic: not a politician or a soldier, but a random person. This person would be an abstraction, really. They are everyone precisely because they are no one in particular. What would matter is the image. The video had to be made, the event had to be broadcast. This matters more than the killing itself.Now will come the courtroom arguments about whether this is a serious plot or empty, youthful bravado, but they will have no public purchase. Terrorism is all about the fear, the anxiety, the outrage. It's nothing without it. And what can scare or outrage us more than the thought of ISIL within?And it's that thought that perhaps has the most to teach us in Australia. ISIL is not simply a group to be vanquished. It is not a fixed, finite, collection of people we can somehow control or eradicate. For us in Australia, it's most dangerously a symbol: a brand a young man from Sydney can claim for himself; a flag in which he can wrap himself, and his proposed victim. For all its pretensions to statehood, the key thing is that it's anything but. It exists in the mind as much as on land.So it's not the kind of thing we can simply destroy with military force. Modern terrorism doesn't work that way. We keep killing "senior figures" in terrorist groups – indeed, it's more than three years since we killed the most senior of them all – and nothing substantive changes. We tried to smash al-Qaeda. It fragmented, then morphed into a mass movement not truly under anyone's direct control, with Osama bin Laden mostly a symbolic figurehead. Then it begat ISIL.This yields a devilish problem: namely, that we are trying to confront a threat that exists nowhere in particular, and anywhere in theory. We can't destroy that. Not in the short term and not with the kind of conventional force the state has at its disposal. What we can do is manage it. Arrest, prosecute, convict. The good news is, we're good at that. The bad news is that this isn't a cure. It's the (certainly necessary) treatment of symptoms.Long-term, it's about us. It's about how resilient we are as a society, and how focused we are in our response. There is one very clear way in which this alleged plot can succeed, even if it is never carried out: that we become so emotionally manipulated, so provoked, that we end up helplessly polarised. That becomes a problem because a symbol as ghastly as ISIL can only prosper in a febrile atmosphere."Right now is a time for calm," urged NSW police commissioner Andrew Scipione. "We don't need to whip this up."He's entirely right, but even as he says this he must be asking himself a very scary question: is that going to be possible?Waleed Aly is a Fairfax columnist and a lecturer in politics at Monash University.
**********What would success in Iraq look like?********September 5, 2014******196**** If we're going to get involved once more in a military campaign in Iraq, there is a question we simply must answer: what exactly will success look like? It's perhaps the single most catastrophically ignored question of the post-9/11 era. It's the question we never answered in defining the War on Terror. And it's the question we never answered (or even asked) before the disaster that was the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which is precisely why we had no workable plan for the post-Saddam nation. That's why we ended up with the ridiculous "Mission Accomplished" spectacle about eight years before American troops finally left. And as we head inexorably back into the Iraqi vortex, it is a question I fear we won't answer yet again. The mission as defined so far seems simple enough: to perform the humanitarian act of preventing a genocide. And let me be clear: that is about the noblest human endeavour there is. The trouble is that it's too general to be an adequate answer. We need to know in far more precise terms what that means, what we will need to see before we can be certain the genocide has been averted, exactly when we can say "Mission Accomplished' and actually mean it. Does it, for example, mean ISIL is confined to a particular area? If so, which areas? Does it mean that the groups ISIL is so keen to exterminate will be adequately armed to defend themselves – kind of like the Iraqi military we're meant already to have trained? Does it mean ISIL's total elimination? If so, how exactly do we plan to achieve that almost certainly impossible task? And if not, what concrete circumstances will allow us to say with confidence that ISIL's genocidal project won't simply resume the moment Western forces leave? Are we proposing – or even prepared – to stay involved indefinitely?  Does our objective ultimately require the creation of a strong, inclusive Iraqi state, and if so, how do we create this given we've failed miserably on this score for 11 years? Oh, and if we're arming Kurdish militias now to fight ISIL, what's our plan in the entirely conceivable event they decide they'd really rather have their own state separate from Iraq?  How do we feel about the prospect of a civil war, which, incidentally might just provide the kind of fertile environment for terrorist and insurgent groups like ISIL to revive themselves? If we cannot answer these sorts of questions definitively, then even the most morally compelling military interventions are liable to mutate into something else.  A modest, preventative humanitarian campaign can quickly become a sprawling, ill-defined mess. Indeed, you can already see the signs of escalation. "Our objective is to degrade and destroy ISIL so that it's no longer a threat," declared Barack Obama this week, which is a very far cry from the narrower aim of genocide-prevention.  If Obama is serious about crushing ISIL, then he can't do it merely with air strikes in Iraq. He'll have to take his soldiers into Syria, which is the wellspring of so much of ISIL's force. Is this something he is seriously contemplating? Are we planning to fight alongside Bashar al-Assad now after three years of calling for his fall? Is Obama  prepared to resort to ground troops when it becomes clear he can't take out an amorphous terrorist organisation from the sky?  Precisely what strategy the Obama administration has in mind is, at this point, unknowable. What we do know is that whatever military campaign America ultimately settles on, and whatever it is the Americans ask of us, we'll provide it.  We've shown already our involvement is elastic. What began as humanitarian aid drops has expanded to providing weapons to Kurdish militias, and – Tony Abbott acknowledges – might now extend to providing our fanciest planes for airstrikes on ISIL targets. There are no clear, non-negotiable limits at this point; nothing we can definitively rule out.  There are merely reassurances that certain specific requests have not been made.  But that rather sidesteps the crucial question: what will we do when they are? I don't doubt the urgent, visceral humanitarian concern that's driving us here.  That voice from within that screams "do something!" – I hear it, too. I don't even believe military intervention is necessarily wrong in this case, in the way it plainly was in 2003. There is a genuine threat to confront, the Iraqi government is asking for this military support, and we may even have a responsibility under international law to protect the vulnerable. As a matter of principle I'm perfectly open to the idea that a military campaign is necessary in a way that was simply never true in 2003.  But wars don't remain matters of principle for long. They generate real, concrete, irreversible and unpredictable consequences. Indeed the current disaster is one such consequence. And the fact that some manner of intervention might be necessary doesn't mean the same is true for whatever intervention we might happen to dream up. No, our objectives, our measures of success and our overarching strategy need to be more than noble. They need to be as precise and concrete as those consequences we're about to unleash. Right now, they're not. We can rectify that, but there are questions to answer, and I'm not sure we're even asking them.
**********Citizenship: how Zaky Mallah became an object of hate to justify government's tough talk********June 25, 2015******268**** I have a simple question: do we want terrorists to be in this country or not? For the "no" case, I give you Tony Abbott, who so desperately does "not want terrorists loose on our streets" that he has released a bill to snatch dual nationals' Australian citizenship away if they've gone to fight with Islamic State. In truth, it does massively more than that, but the central intent seems clear: to ensure terrorists who have left the country can't get back in.For the "yes" case, I give you …Tony Abbott, whose government has cheerfully cancelled the passports of something like 80 Australians with designs on leaving. If we assume the government thinks they're terrorists, then we're actively forcing these people to run loose on our streets, rather than Syria's where, given Islamic State's current strategy with Western recruits, they'd most likely be killed quickly as cannon fodder.Meanwhile we've undergone a whole legislative process to create new criminal offences of being in the wrong place without an excuse. Remember the no-go zones? It's a scheme that more or less assumes people are coming back, presumably to be prosecuted. And yet, when shadow attorney-general Mark Dreyfus suggested this would be a good thing, suddenly he was "rolling out the red carpet for terrorists".All of which raises the question: if the main game was always to institute what Abbott this week described as a modern form of "banishment", why all this legislation for the laying of red carpet last year? Wouldn't that banishment be your starting point, from which everything else is proceeds?There's a confusion here we're serenely ignoring. And there's a reason for that: we're not on a search for consistency. We're not committed to a series of carefully worked out principles that we're now seeking to apply. We don't even have a functioning theory of what it is that exacerbates or diminishes the threat of terrorism.There's a bit of talk about working with communities and promoting social cohesion, then a dollop of bellicose rhetoric about Muslim leaders not condemning terrorism enough and not meaning it when they do, which swiftly trashes whatever community goodwill was meant to have been accumulated. There's lots of talk about evil death cults which describes something, but goes nowhere near explaining it.Meanwhile there's lots – and lots – of aggressive posturing that seems to regard any resistance, even in the form of the constitution, as vaguely seditious. The point here that can barely still be called implicit, is that it is nearly impossible to go too far in this fight. It's the logic on Guantanamo, writ small.Thus we end up with a collection of policies seemingly at odds with one another, unified only by their conspicuous toughness. Right now, that's the only form of consistency you need. You can say you're acting on the advice of experts like Bret Walker, the former National Security Legislation Monitor, and then when he says you're misrepresenting him, tell him he wouldn't really know and plough on regardless. None of it matters. Indeed, nothing matters except the thought that we're holding the biggest sledgehammer we can find; the catharsis of smashing things. We're riding visceral emotion here.So on Monday, when Zaky Mallah emerged to dump wildfire on the conversation, his timing was impeccable. This was the week these citizenship laws were finally to surface. These laws raise issues that are not only obvious, but utterly foundational: the rule of law, the expansion of executive power, the extraordinarily loose pretexts on which the most seminal right we have – citizenship – could simply be extinguished. In some ways, Mallah was the perfect person to ask the question. He's a man acquitted of terrorism charges – which is to say he is, officially speaking, not a terrorist – whose citizenship the government would gleefully dissolve if it had the power. On this issue, he's the very embodiment of the difference between law and politics.But in this environment, and given his penchant for incendiary remarks, he's none of those things. He is instead an emblem of outrage; the symbolic enemy through whom every war can be fought (including as it happens, a very tired culture war against the ABC that has finally found its way to the News Limited tabloids equating it with Islamic State).Mallah clearly thinks he's raising issues of principle, but a figure like him can only ever smother them. He's become the licence to emote; the cover that means we need never look at boring abstract issues like the separation of powers. The truth is that for all the outrage from government figures this week, Mallah is a gift to them: the object of hate that justifies almost any conceivable measure and makes their aggression a virtue. Who can resist a "tough" policy when Zaky Mallah is standing right there?This is about more than the politicisation of terrorism. That, after all, is an old custom, which only runs aground when you get it horribly wrong – as the Howard government did in 2007 when it tried to parade Mohamed Haneef around as its prize terrorism catch.Rather this is about legitimising our most thoughtless instincts and debasing even the most sober criticism. Watch. From here, it's not just Zaky Mallah who will be radical. It will be everything he seemed to think he was raising. It will be the notion of due process. It will be any suspicion of government overreach. And it will be any Muslim voice who dares question our counter-terrorism settings or who argues government action is further alienating young Muslims and thereby increasing radicalisation. Say that and you're practically a member of Islamic State. Just like that guy on Q&A.
**********James Foley beheading baits America to intervene********August 22, 2014******249**** "Without these videos and photos and firsthand experience, you can't really tell the world how bad it might be."  When you consider that these are the words of James Foley, the very same American journalist whose own brutish beheading at the hands of ISIS was this week filmed and posted online, it's about as chillingly foreboding as it gets.  Foley wanted us to know the horrors of Syria.  He devoted the last stage of his life to it.  But it is by his own horrific death that he has most shockingly told us how bad things might be.Now comes the search for meaning; for what this horror signifies.  The incorrigible extremism of ISIS, certainly.  But that much has already been proven at length as it has tried to perpetrate a genocide against local Yazidis, and routinely beheaded Christians.  And yet there is something different about this development that deserves our attention: something that reveals not merely ISIS's barbarism, but its weakness.When you are beheading locals, and stringing up the severed heads for public display, you're clearly doing more than killing people.  ISIS's rampant violence has thus far not merely been a campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide, but one more broadly of intimidation and control.  Certainly, it has wanted to exterminate non-Muslims.  But it has also been keen to eliminate Shiite Muslims and or even Sunnis it deems insufficiently obedient.  It has been trying desperately to assert authority over the territory it claims to control. The violence was public and local, with the very clear aim of gaining total compliance.This was ISIS in Jacobin mode; its post-revolutionary Régime de la Terreur.  In this respect at least ISIS was attempting to live up to its pretentious new brand: not as a group aspiring to a state, but as a state already achieved. Hence, "Islamic State", a rebranding that has always been dubious and was from the very start rejected even by its extreme Islamist cousins.  But at least it could plausibly lay claim to a serious chunk of territory straddling the Iraq-Syria border.  This was a movement on the march, whose advance had proven irresistible.Now there is resistance.  On the ground this has come in the form of the Iraqi military and especially Kurdish militias enjoying perhaps their first ever serious wave of international support.  From the air it has taken the form of US strikes, that have clearly pushed ISIS back from the Kurdish city of Erbil, and helped deliver the strategically crucial Mosul Dam into Kurdish hands.  For the moment, the Americans are pretty chuffed: "their morale is suffering, their competency and capacity has been damaged" declared the Pentagon press secretary this week.This could, of course, be the Obama administration's own spin.  But James Foley's execution suggests there is plenty of truth to it. This is not a local act of intimidation intended to establish and consolidate the power of a fledgling, self-declared state.  This is a global broadcast intended to draw a reaction from a global audience.  And it is this fact alone – far more than the literal content of the threats ISIS is making – that speaks volumes, here.  This week ISIS left behind its Jacobin pretensions and returned to its al-Qaedaist nature. It went from Terror (which is what the state does), to terrorism (which is what the militant without a state does).Thus are ISIS's motives abundantly plain.  It is doing what terrorist groups must do: recruiting.  And the best way to do that is to agitate and provoke; to radicalise the environment.  On this score, ISIS is treading an extremely well-worn path.  The aim is to put on a show of commitment and strength; something so confident and shocking that it will impress potential recruits. That's why Foley had to be humiliated before being killed.  It's why his death had to be gruesome.  It's a message calculated to give young radicalised Muslims a sense of power.  Indeed, we've seen this before – about a decade ago, from Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's al-Qaeda in Iraq.  As it happened, al-Zarqawi's campaign ended abruptly because it was hopelessly counterproductive.  It repulsed the very people it was intended to impress, and the al-Qaeda leadership pulled al-Zarqawi into line.  ISIS, as is frequently noted, is a more extreme incarnation of al-Qaeda, but it is hard to believe it would pursue this if it believed the practice would still be self-defeating.  So it must have reason to believe it will work differently this time.That reason is most likely that it is operating in radically different circumstances.  Ten years ago the US invasion was young and the carnage was fresh.  America's presence was a major radicalising force in itself, which had energised jihadists all over the world.  For al-Qaeda to behead civilians on film was merely for it to be gratuitous, and to compromise whatever moral appeal it claimed for itself.  But now, America has left.  Its present military reprise is very narrow and limited, nothing like the scale of shock and awe. Moreover it appears determined to keep it that way.That doesn't work for ISIS.  It needs America.  More to the point, it needs American intervention on a much grander scale.  However much it protests that it wants Obama to cease air strikes, it plainly seeks the opposite: to provoke the American public with something impossible to ignore, something so grotesque that it demands retaliation.  ISIS wants the American public screaming for Obama to escalate. It's about the oldest terrorist tactic there is.  Provoke overreaction, provide a magnet for radicalisation, swell the ranks and watch the cycle of violence unfold.  Indeed, this is precisely the story of the past decade or so.  James Foley's murder is about whether or not that will be the story of the next one.
