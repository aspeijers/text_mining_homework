**********Drones: the killing is cheap but the price high********May 31, 2013******123**** With great power comes unaccountability. Until now the Western world, under the cover of the world's sole superpower, has scarcely needed to engage with the ethics of using armed drones. Occasionally, a drone strike would make the news. Occasionally, some commentator or other would gnash teeth. Almost always anti-American anger and resentment would grow in the countries where the strike happened. But ultimately, no one can actually do anything about any of this. So, overwhelmingly the Obama administration gave no answers to questions that weren't asked.But all that's changing. US President Barack Obama has just confessed that using drones is not ''wise or moral in every instance'', and that they should be used as a last resort. This is largely a response to growing US discontent about his administration's mysterious drone program. We now know that American drones have killed four of the country's own citizens. So the President is asking Congress to help him develop some kind of oversight for American drone use to ensure they are used only against people who are ''a continuing, imminent threat to Americans'' and cannot be captured.Obama's reckoning with the ethics of drones is welcome. But what if it's too late? What if he's unleashed a mode of warfare he cannot control, and we'll come one day to regret?It seems inevitable that lots of countries – including ones that make the West uncomfortable – will soon enough have drones of their own. Perhaps the most overlooked story of the year comes from China, where the People's Liberation Army hatched a plan to send a drone to Myanmar to assassinate a drug trafficker who had murdered 13 Chinese nationals. As it happens, the Chinese government didn't go ahead with it, but not because it couldn't. In fact, China is developing quite a fleet. And it has plans to share them around.A US drone costs anywhere from $5 million to $10 million. Depending on who you believe, China can build them for less than $1 million. If that's true, you can forget any idea of an American monopoly on the drone market. Now consider China's customers: countries who want cheap weapons, and who'd rather not buy them from America or Israel. Really, anyone in the developing world is a candidate. It's hard to resist the conclusion that we're staring at the future of warfare.Is that a bad thing? To date the arguments for and against drones have focused on civilian casualties. Put briefly, critics claim a high civilian toll from the American program, while its defenders claim drones have greater precision, get into places that soldiers can't and, therefore, limit what is so grotesquely called ''collateral damage''. The focus on civilian deaths is noble, but for now at least the argument is futile. The truth – indeed the very problem – is that we're almost completely in the dark on this.No one knows how many civilians have been killed. The British-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism puts the number at more than 1000, but there's no way of knowing. The US government hints that the figure is lower, but won't give one of its own, and even if it did it might not mean much.But even if we could get a reliable figure, it's unclear precisely what it would mean. The problem here is that we're dealing with a counter-factual. How many civilians would have died if conventional weapons were used instead? How many (if any) of these  strikes would not have gone ahead if drones weren't available? Again, we can't say. And, sadly, we're in an era when civilian deaths are deemed an acceptable inevitability of war, rather than a reason to avoid it.Whatever the truth of these claims and counter-claims, perhaps the best objections to drone warfare have nothing to do with pragmatic arguments over counting  bodies. The central problem is drones permit a kind of no-risk, low-cost warfare. Indeed, they so radically and fundamentally alter the nature of war that they risk making war seem far less grave, and far easier to wage.War is a kind of contract. Each side confronts the other, with the risk of death and defeat. In short, war should come at a cost. That contract is shredded when you're attacked by something that cannot itself be killed. It's not remotely a fair fight. It's scarcely a fight at all. For all the horror, pain, and gore of the battlefield, there's something to be said for it. It's one of the very best reasons every nation has not to go to war. The greater the sacrifice, the graver the decision to fight. That's why the Vietnam War – fought by people conscripted into the army – was so much more toxic for the US government than the Iraq War. You're more likely to proceed with a strike based on sketchy intelligence if you're risking only the lives of faceless civilians, and not any of your soldiers. The prospect of waging a war without sacrifice is a  frightening prospect. It makes war that much more disposable; that much closer to being waged on a whim. And no gesture of congressional oversight is going to change that.Is this the kind of calculus of war we want? The historical record suggests our every military development seems to have made war less and less costly for those waging it, with horrific results. Once, rulers risked their own lives on the battlefield. Then the lives of ordinary citizens, called up by conscription. Now they risk the lives of professional soldiers who make the choice to get in harm's way. And in the meantime the ratio of civilian casualties to those of combatants has ballooned.
**********Tory politics: pact to the rafters in contradiction********May 17, 2013******113**** At the risk of blaspheming, allow me to contend that there is something more important in politics than who has power and for how long they will retain it. Power, after all, is a means. Its meaning lies in how it is used, not in who is using it. So let me propose an alternative way of understanding politics: ask not who is winning and losing, but rather who is asking the questions, and who is being forced to provide answers.In that connection, two remarkable things have happened this week. The first was the federal budget, which announced an $18 billion deficit, cut back on handouts, took more in tax, and funded enormous projects in education, infrastructure and disability services. It's astonishing because until now, this government's budgets have been overwhelmingly about answering one question: when will you deliver a surplus? That is the Coalition's question. For some reason, the government felt compelled to answer it. That might have changed on Tuesday night.The second was a gobsmacking poll published in The Guardian that showed support for the anti-European UK Independence Party has doubled in the space of a month. Doubled! It's now polling at 18 per cent - ahead of the Liberal Democrats, who are the junior partner in the governing coalition - and only 10 points behind the Tories. Of those who voted Conservative in the 2010 elections, a whopping 27 per cent are now parking their vote with UKIP. This is like Katter's Australia Party polling well ahead of the Greens and within striking distance of the Coalition. British pollsters haven't seen anything like it for decades, or perhaps at all. Now Prime Minister David Cameron is going through all sorts of contortions to placate his euro-sceptic backbenchers. He might be in power, but he's answering to UKIP.At first blush, both these developments tell the story of government in crisis. In Cameron's case that much is obvious. In Wayne Swan's case, it is as though he has accepted his impending demise, shelving even the customary attempt to win back the electorate with cash. But I think something bigger is slowly being revealed. Something about the nature of modern conservative politics.Let's begin in Britain. You'd presume UKIP's rise meant Britain was caught in the grip of a raging anti-European fever. Actually the proportion of voters who want to quit the EU has dropped since January, and not even 10 per cent think it's the country's most pressing concern. No, UKIP's success is not really about Europe. It symbolises a kind of anti-politics. Theirs is the ultimate protest vote, based on a sense that the major parties have nothing to say to them.That is not merely a British feeling. In America, the Tea Party has a clearer ideological purpose, but nonetheless trades heavily on its disdain for Washington insiders. And in Australia the analogy with Katter's Australia Party suggests itself. The mobilising issues vary, but the fact these movements sit on the conservative side of politics means their disillusionment is most clearly directed at what modern conservative politics has become.Namely, it has become synonymous with the free market. Indeed, the ideological victory of market liberalism is frequently cited as conservative politics' most decisive modern victory. But the fact that it was ostensibly conservative leaders like Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan who led the free market charge conceals the fact that, actually, this kind of market ideology isn't very conservative at all.It undermines exactly the kinds of social institutions conservatives celebrate - family, for instance - by making us work more irregular and unpredictable hours. It opens the door for the commodification of whatever will sell - even if that means unconservative consequences like the hyper-sexualisation of advertising. The free market is a grand, global, and systemic idea. Conservatism is traditionally particular, local and social. In short, modern conservative politics came to be built on a contradiction: a pact between the opposing forces of free market liberalism and social conservatism.For a time, that contradiction has been obscured. Good economic conditions certainly helped. But now the pact is beginning to fray. The world is different now. The financial crisis has left once dominant capitalist economies gasping, while the inevitable rise of Asia looms large in our imaginations. We're entering a new phase in which the Western world is no longer globalisation's biggest winner.Bob Katter's constituency have long been globalisation's losers. That's why he frets so much about Australia being a net importer of food. He's not joking when he talks about farmers committing suicide as their farms became uncompetitive. But now more people are likely to have a sense of what he's talking about - and he might just do some damage in Queensland this September.Katter and UKIP are, in some muddled way, attempting to capture what conservative politics lost when it got radically liberal: an abiding concern for the local, and privileging of the local, and a rejection of political programs that bring huge structural change. They're highlighting the contradiction of modern conservatism; it is a contradiction Tony Abbott will confront when he tries to introduce a parental leave scheme that is as conservative as it is opposed to the free market ideology of his party.There's a vulnerability here, and it's not going anywhere. That's what makes this week's budget so interesting. It's not just introducing a new tax. It's trying to reset the basic relationship of government and citizen. Government will build lots of infrastructure, and pump massive funds into education and disability services. Citizens will, frankly, pay for it. Hence, no more handouts and tighter tax schemes. The philosophical intent is clear.As a result there are questions for the Coalition to answer. And Labor's asking the questions it hasn't really asked before. What is Abbott prepared to sacrifice on the altar of a surplus? Education? Disability? Infrastructure? What will he cut in order to re-establish the baby bonus? Which government services matter less than these payments?How Abbott answers these questions threatens to drive him straight into a conflict between the same contradictory forces UKIP and Katter exploit. It's market liberalism against the more socially minded approach that conservatism is currently neglecting. It's all too late for September, of course. But it might just matter beyond then.

**********Lights, camera, China: dollar sinos in the eyes********May 3, 2013******92**** Turns out Robert Downey jnr is a Sinophile. ''I live a very Chinese life in America,'' he recently declared. I don't know what that means, either. But I'm pretty sure it has a lot to do with money. He was speaking at the international promotional launch of Iron Man 3, which took place not in Los Angeles, New York or London but in Beijing. Behind the gates of the Forbidden City, no less.None of this happened by accident. When Iron Man 3 hits Chinese cinemas today, audiences will be seeing a special edit of the film made just for them. It will feature extra sequences shot in China and expanded roles for a couple of Chinese film stars. It will have lucrative product placement from the Chinese tech giant TCL. Indeed, the entire film is a collaboration between Disney and the Chinese production studio, DMG Entertainment.The film market reflects the geopolitics of our age. America will not much longer be an unrivalled superpower, and China's rise is unstoppable. ''There's always been a number two,'' explained DMG CEO Dan Mintz. ''But this is the first time anyone is challenging for number one.'' It will win that challenge by 2020. The quest for the Chinese dollar is on. And it has been ever since James Cameron grossed 222 million of them with Avatar.But that means playing by Chinese rules. In Iron Man 3's case, Chinese government officials were on set to ''monitor filming''. And several other films have shown similar, um, sensitivity. Ugly depictions of the sex trade in Macau (a Chinese territory) were reportedly dumped from Skyfall, as was a scene in which a Chinese security guard is assassinated. The apocalyptic zombies in World War Z were the result of a Chinese SARS-like virus, until Paramount thought better of it and made the source a Moscow flu, first spotted - of course - by a Chinese scientist. Then there's the 2012 remake of Red Dawn with an altered plot that has the US invaded not by China, but by North Korea. Or Looper, which depicts a future in which the capital of the world is Beijing, rather than Paris, which was the original plan.I could go on, but the pattern is clear. ''The adjustment of some of our films for different world markets is a commercial reality, and we recognise China's right to determine what content enters their country,'' said a spokesman for the Motion Picture Association of America. That's management-speak for ''we have no choice about this if we want to make money … and we do''.Clearly not everyone is terribly comfortable about all this. A quick scan of the news coverage of Hollywood's Chinese courtship turns up headlines about ''bowing'' and ''kowtowing'' to Chinese sensibilities.Similarly, when Qantas announced recently that, owing to its new partnership with Emirates, pork would not be available on flights going through Dubai, a portion of the Australian population proceeded to lose its mind, threatening to boycott Qantas, condemning it for ''sleeping with the Islamic enemy'' and venting its outrage that ''[our] religion has been disrespected by the removal of pork products'' - because apparently eating pork is now some kind of sacrament. Meanwhile, Qantas' ticket sales to Europe have increased 500 per cent.Welcome to the Asian century. It begins with commerce, but it must inevitably encompass so much more than that. We talk often about how economic power brings with it political and military power. Less frequently do we recognise that it brings extraordinary cultural power, too. So if the age of Western economic domination is coming slowly to an end, so too is the age of Western cultural domination. Hollywood's Chinese dalliance, or Qantas' new menu are merely the seedlings of this inevitable change.It has never been completely true that globalisation is entirely something the West does to the East. But it is certainly true that its impacts are not evenly felt. Some Eastern phenomena do travel west - Bollywood and Gangnam Style being perhaps the cheesiest examples - but for sheer cultural hegemony, nothing really competes with the Western world. It is a rare country that escaped all Americanisation of its culture during the 20th century.But the worm of globalisation is turning. Those screeching at pork-free Qantas flights have probably never given any thought to the fact that almost every Middle Eastern airline - including Emirates - serves alcohol, subordinating the region's own cultural and religious norms to the desires of paying customers. I doubt we'd ever call that ''kowtowing''.Very few of us will have wondered what it must be like for the developed world to face a steady bombardment of Western sitcoms, action flicks and romantic comedies that, at least until now, were made without a second thought for their compatibility with the cultural values of those societies. What must it mean to an Asian musician to know that the only path to global stardom is through Western music alone, and that even then the chances are far slimmer than for their American counterparts? We've probably never considered what impact it must have on dark-skinned women around the world to see the fashion centres of Europe producing globally famous, overwhelmingly white supermodels, which must surely reinforce notions of beauty they can never attain without buying some whitening cream or other. (Which they do. A lot.)These aren't malicious plots. We don't mean for such things to happen; they just do as the inexorable result of power. Indeed, the privilege of cultural supremacy means we don't even need to think about it. But some day that privilege will change hands. We, in the West, with almost no experience of anything other than complete cultural control will have to come to grips with it. Not for a while. Several decades, probably. But it won't be niggle-free. We aren't all Robert Downey jnr. Not all of us can comfortably claim to live very Chinese lives.
**********Noisy bigots drown out silent bias********April 4, 2013******272**** As opening lines in letters go, "I find you deeply offensive", is pretty direct. Fair enough. I suspect lots of people do. It's a natural consequence of media work. But then my anonymous correspondent decided to explain why: "You are foreign, you shall always be so. Piss off back to whatever Middle Eastern sinkhole you blew in here from."There's nothing surprising about this. There's nothing even particularly rare about it. Some version of that letter arrives every few months. This one was particularly unvarnished – complete with references to my wife and "half-caste kids" and cheerful threats of the return of the White Australia Policy – but the message hardly varies: this isn't my country and my public presence is unwelcome, either because I'm a Muslim, or because in some racially determinable way not a "real" Australian. I've been accused of everything from taking elocution lessons to changing the spelling of my name to appear deceptively Australian before I unleash some Trojan conspiracy. Apparently, Aly is roughly equivalent to Smith. They're onto me.I have almost no emotional reaction to this kind of goonish racism. It's simply too ridiculous to engage me. In fact, I'd completely forgotten about this most recent letter until racist ranting hit the headlines this week following yet another racist diatribe on a Sydney bus that was captured and posted to YouTube. It's at least the third such case in about four months. Hence the fresh round of debate on Australian racism that always seems to follow the same unedifying pattern.First comes the shock, as though such incidents reveal something we never knew existed. Then comes the argument over whether or not Australia is a racist country. Frankly, I don't know what the argument means. Every country has racism. How much do you need before a country itself is racist? Is it a matter of essence or degree? Do we judge it by surveying legislation, newspapers or behaviour on public transport? And even if we can answer those questions, then what?That argument is a dead end. It's more about a condemnatory label than the substance and nature of Australian racism. The real question is not about which adjective describes us. It's about how best to identify and respond to the racism we inevitably harbour.Debating the meaning of the occasional racist tirade does not help answer that. It's just not that helpful to take extreme individual behaviour as the starting point on an issue like this. Sure, it's troubling. Sure, it's more common than we like to admit. Sure, it's a problem. But it's not the problem. The racism that really matters in Australia isn't the high-level, weapons-grade derangement that winds its way via YouTube into the news.The truth is we can't compete with Europe for hardcore white nationalism or the US for white supremacist movements. We can't compete with Asia or the Middle East for the maintenance of an explicit, institutionalised and sometimes codified racial hierarchy. Our racial and religious minorities are not having their communities torched (though the occasional building has been firebombed), and our handful of far-right politicians aren't leading political parties that attract 20 per cent of the vote.No, our real problem is the subterranean racism that goes largely unremarked upon and that we seem unable even to detect. Like the racism revealed by an Australian National University study, which found you are significantly less likely to get a job interview if you have a non-European name. The researchers sent fake CVs in response to job advertisements, changing only the name of the applicant. It turns out that if your surname is Chinese, you have to apply for 68 per cent more jobs to get the same number of interviews as an Anglo-Australian. If you are Middle Eastern, it's 64 per cent. If you are indigenous, 35 per cent.This is the polite racism of the educated middle class. It's not as shocking as the viral racist tirades we've seen lately. No doubt the human resources managers behind these statistics would be genuinely appalled by such acts of brazen, overt racism. Indeed, they probably enforce racial discrimination rules in their workplace and are proud to do so. Nonetheless, theirs is surely a more devastating, enduring racism. There is no event to film, just the daily, invisible operation of a silent, pervasive prejudice. It does not get called out. It's just the way things are; a structure of society.That is what bothers me about all the fuss that surrounds these occasional racist diatribes. It puts the focus overwhelmingly on the most exceptional kinds of racist behaviour. But are we capable of recognising racism when it isn't gobsmackingly obvious? Recall, for example, the widespread failure to understand why former Telstra boss Sol Trujillo felt racially offended at being caricatured relentlessly as a sleepy, sombrero-wearing Mexican on a donkey, or described as a "Mexican bandit". Certainly, criticise his management of Telstra but can we really not see the gratuitous racial stereotyping? And Trujillo is not even Mexican.Or note the strange Australian comfort with adopting blackface. Remember when Qantas gave two Wallabies fans free tickets because they promised to dress as Radike Samo by blacking up and donning Afro wigs? No offence meant. Qantas apologised. But that's the thing about racism: it goes beyond intentions. The most insidious kind is just so ingrained it's involuntary. It's not about what Qantas intended. It's that no one responsible for the decision even saw the existence of the problem. That sort of thing worries me much more than some crude, anonymous hate mail.It's easy to point at the barking racists on the bus precisely because they aren't us. They allow us to exonerate ourselves; to declare that if we have a problem with racism, at least people like us are not responsible for it. It allows us to escape self-examination of the racism we all probably harbour to some extent or other. That self-examination is crucial. Without it we have nothing to fix, and only other people to blame.
**********Public loses out as self-interest rules********March 22, 2013******32**** What happens to media reform now? The government, having declared the importance and urgency of its reform package, has promptly dumped it in an admission of defeat. It's a story of such political mishandling that it almost rolled a sitting prime minister. But it's also the story of a diabolical problem that might now never be solved in this country.A good starting point is to note the story that in so many ways set this issue alight - that Britain's News of the World had hacked into a murdered schoolgirl's phone and deleted voicemail messages - was incorrect.The hacking happened but the most outrageous part of the story didn't: the messages were probably deleted automatically. Five months after The Guardian broke the original story, it published a colossal correction and consequential corrections to 37 stories.By then the damage was done. The Leveson inquiry was well under way. News of the World had been shut down after 168 years. The schoolgirl's family had already been offered £2 million ($2.9 million). Former editor Rebekah Brooks resigned as chief executive of News International. A suite of reporters and editors (Brooks included) were arrested.It's a richly ironic study in media accuracy, power and accountability. This untrue report blew the lid off a much greater truth: that illegal phone hacking was rampant in News Corporation's British tabloids. It triggered Britain's grandest interrogation of media standards, yet the report would surely have breached those standards. Moreover, it shows just how much irreversible damage an inaccurate media report can do.It therefore symbolises the importance of a free media at the same time as it provides a powerful case for media regulation.And so, this week, Britain reached its political conclusion, with the three main parties agreeing on a tough new regulatory regime. It creates an independent regulator with the power to impose fines of up to £1 million. The scheme is voluntary but media organisations that don't sign up will have to pay greater compensation to any victims who successfully sue them than those who do. Media organisations are predictably upset.Several publications, including The Daily Telegraph in London and The Spectator, are threatening to boycott the regime.This neatly captures the paradox at the heart of media regulation. Repeated serious breaches of journalistic standards mean we cannot trust media with the power they have and yet we can't trust anyone with the power to hold them seriously accountable, either. Both the media and the political class have their own interests. And yet the one interest that counts - the public interest - goes unrepresented.The result is a vacuum that allows each protagonist to pretend their interest is really the public's. In the case of politicians, the suspicion we should have of their motives is obvious. But the media's argument is no less self-serving. By framing the entire issue as one of free speech, the media positions itself as the defender of an inviolable principle. But you won't hear media companies discuss how their commercial interests might compromise free speech as a matter of routine.So let's think this through from first principles. Free speech is fundamental to democracy because it allows competing views to be tested against each other in what is frequently called the ''marketplace of ideas''. This helps citizens understand the pros and cons of the ideas on which they will ultimately vote.But that's not merely an argument for press freedom. It's also an argument for press responsibility. After all, the free market analogy only works if you import the assumptions on which the free market is based - chief among them that consumers have access to perfect information in making their choices. That's the media's role. Unfortunately, we in the media are in no position to claim we fulfil it. Not while fabricating stories that Australia's leading male television presenters are ''united'' in their ''concerns about the government's controversial media reforms'' when this is brazenly false. That's just flat out market distortion.And, right now, it happens pretty much without consequence beyond the odd apology. Even the argument that media outlets will be punished for such conduct by disgruntled customers doesn't remedy the situation. Australia's media ownership is so narrow, and competition so scarce, that there's little scope for the market to uphold standards.So what is the mechanism for accountability?This is the crux of the issue. Media self-regulation fails not because it produces lax codes of conduct, or because those codes aren't applied. It fails because it doesn't matter if they are. The Press Council, for instance, has no power to order fines or compensation. It can't even order something as pedestrian as an apology or correction. It can merely call for one. It is therefore subordinate to its members, who can even hold it to ransom by threatening to withdraw funding.All this combines to make media among the most unaccountable industries we have. The only breaches to be met with force are those serious enough to involve the courts. See Britain.Perhaps this week's entanglement over the government's public interest media advocate might have been avoided. A potent Press Council, with the power to impose real penalties, might just have been effective enough. Sure, that leaves questions about penalties. But those questions are surely easier to resolve than the paradox of a political class setting the rules that govern its adversary.
